Simple SquirrelMail plugin that displays a quote above the message listing.

Original code contributed by paulm@spider.org, now maintained by the
SquirrelMail Project Team.

Plugin requires /usr/games/fortune or any other similar program, that outputs 
short text messages. If you are running PHP in safe_mode, the path to this
program must be present in the PHP safe_mode_exec_dir setting. If you are
running a chrooted webserver, program must be present inside of your
chroot jail.
