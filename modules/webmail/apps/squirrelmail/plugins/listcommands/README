List Commands plugin

This plugin gives the user a menu of mailinglist options such as
(un)subscribe, help and archives when viewing messages from compliant
mailinglists.


Description
===========

The plugin is an implementation of RFC 2369, "The Use of URLs as Meta-Syntax
for Core Mail List Commands and their Transport through Message Header Fields",
to be found at ftp://nis.nsf.net/internet/documents/rfc/rfc2369.txt.

Compliant mailinglistservers add extra headers with each message they send out
with information about how to (un)subscribe, get help or contact the list
owner. This can either be a web location or an emailaddress. In the latter
case, one needs to send an email to that address in order to complete an action
like subscribing.

The information in these headers is used to generate an extra menuline on
messages containing one or more of these headers to help users taking advantage
of the features offered.


Installation
============

Go to the main directory, run configure and add the plugin.


Acknowledgements
================
The listcommands plugin has been originally created by Thijs Kinkhorst and is
now under the control of the SquirrelMail Project Team.

I'd like to thank Peter Walker, Wouter Teepe, Jason Edwards and Phillipe Mingo
for their useful contributions to this plugin.
