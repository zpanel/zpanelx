Bug Reporter Plugin For SquirrelMail

Need to submit a bug?  Need to know valuable system information?  Need
to be accurate?  This should do it for you.


Features
========

* You save yourself a lot of typing
* By default, this is not enabled.
* Provides detailed setup information to help diagnose your problem
* Has some warnings that can help out the person submitting the bug report


Description
===========

When people stumble across a bug, which may happen in a work-in-progress,
often times they would like to help out the software and get rid of the bug.
Sometimes, these people don't know much about the system and how it is set
up -- they know enough to make the bug happen for them.  This bug report
plugin is designed to gather all of the non-private information for the user
automatically, so that the user doesn't need to know more than how to trigger
the bug.


Future Work
===========

* Add more data
* Add more warnings


Installation
============

NOTE!  None of the following is true for this plugin under SquirrelMail
version 1.4.x.  All you need to do is enable the plugin in the main
SquirrelMail configuration.
//FIXME: implement the following?  Backport it from DEVEL...
You must configure this plugin before you enable it in your SquirrelMail
installation.  The plugin's configuration is stored in one of the
following files:

    config/bug_report_config.php
    plugins/bug_report/config.php files.

The default configuration options can be found in (copy this file to
one of the above locations and then edit it to suit you):

    plugins/bug_report/config_default.php

If both configuration files are present, this plugin uses the one in
the config/ directory.

By default, the plugin will only be visible to users listed in the
following files:

    plugins/bug_report/admins
    config/admins

... or only to the user that owns the main SquirrelMail configuration
file.  Other users can use the bug_report plugin if you set a value for
the administrator's email address in the plugin configuration file and
set $bug_report_allow_users option to TRUE.

Once the plugin is configured, go back to the main SquirrelMail
directory, run "configure" and enable the plugin.
