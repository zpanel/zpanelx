Message Translation

If you have ever received a mail message from someone who is not in
your country, you probably noticed that they used a different language
than you. If you don't know their language, a translator might help you
out.


Features
========

* Multiple translation servers
* Uses your language preference for setting up default translation options
* You pick where you see the translation box
* You decide which translation buttons you see


Description
===========

This plugin lets you select, on a per-user basis, the translator you want
to use.  It defaults to None.  It has different servers you can use, and
it lists their strengths and limits with each one.  Also, there are
multiple servers just in case one changes their interface or goes down.

Since SquirrelMail is designed to have multiple translations of the text,
this plugin takes your preference and will use it for selecting what to
translate the text into.


Future Work
===========

* Grab translation directly from server (need to send POST request directly)
* Translate your outgoing message
