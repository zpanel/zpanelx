This plugin is used to notify the user when a new mail arrives. There are
several ways to do this. One is to play a sound through the browser whenever 
the user has unseen messages flagged in the left window pane. There are options 
available (on the options page of course) to disable this feature for each user, 
and to select different media files from the users local computer. The default 
is that this is NOT enabled, so you'll need to go to the options menu to turn 
it on first! There are also options to show a popup window via JavaScript.

Plugin options are visible only when JavaScript is enabled or detected by
SquirrelMail JavaScript detection functions.

From SquirrelMail 1.5.1 newmail plugin's site configuration can be stored in
config/newmail_config.php or plugins/newmail/config.php.

$allowsound setting is replaced with $newmail_allowsound and should be stored
inside plugin's site configuration file.

Plugin supports playback of WAV, SWF, MP3, OGG and SVG media files. Currently
OGG and SVG files are played only by browsers that implement w3.org nested 
objects correctly and browsers that can play <embed> objects. Internet Explorer 
can't play them due to broken <object> implementation. OGG and SVG <object> 
elements specific to IE are not implemented.
