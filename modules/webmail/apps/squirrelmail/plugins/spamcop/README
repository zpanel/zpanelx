SpamCop Reporting

Helps you identify spam and send a proper message to the correct address to
SpamCop.  (See http://spamcop.net/ for more information)


Features
========

* Quick one-click interface to report spam via email
* Alternate, but immediate form-based processing


Description
===========

Tired of getting spam?  SpamCop helps you report it to the proper people.
It even creates spam reports and will mail them off for you.  All that is
required to send a spam report is about a few seconds of your time and about
five clicks.

It is strongly suggested you set up a mail forwarder account and have it
forwarded to your current mailbox.  Sometimes mail reported with SpamCop
gets on weird spam mailing lists.  If your happens to get on the list, you
can then just delete the forwarder and get a new one.  Make sure to use the
forwarder to sign up for SpamCop and get the required information for the
plugin.
