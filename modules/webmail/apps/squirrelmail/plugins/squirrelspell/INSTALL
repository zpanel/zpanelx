SquirrelSpell plugin
--------------------

Modify the sqspell_config.php file making sure you have ispell or aspell
available on your system and located in PHP's path. The squirrelspell
doesn't check for that and if it is not available, you're just going to
get a "No errors found" message every time. :) Quite pleasing, but not
very useful.

Read files in "doc" directory -- they explain some features.

Enable the plugin either by hand or by running the configure script from
your SquirrelMail install directory.

NOTE: If you are using php >= 4.3.0 squirrelspell should work in safe mode.
Otherwise, you may have to disable safe mode for the squirrelspell directory.
   APACHE CONF EXAMPLE:
        <Directory /webroot/squirrelmail/plugins/squirrelspell>
                php_admin_value safe_mode 0
        </Directory>


Enjoy and report bugs. ;)
