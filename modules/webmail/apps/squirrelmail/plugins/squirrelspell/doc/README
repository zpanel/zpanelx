FEATURES:
----------
SquirrelSpell works with UN*X's ISPELL or ASPELL libraries and
SquirrelMail version 1.4 and higher. No PHP recompilation required,
unless you wish to enable MCRYPT support.

* SpellChecker:
ISPELL or ASPELL. It all depends on them. Read configuration parameters in
sqspell_config.php. Starting with version v0.3 supports multiple international
dictionaries.

* User Dictionary:
SquirrelSpell adds words to the user dictionary. You may edit your
dictionary under options->personal options->Edit my dictionary.

* Encryption:
Starting with version v0.3 SquirrelSpell is capable of working with
encrypted user dictionaries. See doc/CRYPTO for information on how to
enable this feature.

* i18n and l10n:
SquirrelSpell supports any international dictionaries provided by ispell
or aspell. However, since there isn't a translation interface available
for SquirrelMail plugins, all messages produced by SquirrelSpell will be
in English.
