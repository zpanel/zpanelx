SQUIRRELSPELL

v0.3.7
------
- General formatting updates, javadoc-style comments, and cleanups.
- Potential privacy vulnerability fixed (possible symlink attack)
- Moving some strings from .js files into .mod or .php so they can be
  translated.
- Miscellaneous code moves and smallish rewrites.
	
v0.3.6
------
- Remote arbirtary execution as apache user vulnerability fix.

v0.3.5
-------
- Making it work with 1.1.1 broke it under 1.0.6. Decided not to support
  developmental versions after this release.

v0.3.4
-------
- Changes to unbreak it in 1.1.1. :)

v0.3.3
-------
- Apparently, magic quotes wasn't a bug, but something introduced in 1.0.6,
  so I took out all magic-quotes escaping routines, since it's done
  automatically now by validate.php.

v0.3.2
-------
- Rolled back changes in v0.3.1
- Workaround for an odd bug with PHP's magic_quotes_gpc
- Changed trim to chop so the newline-trimming function doesn't trim
  leading spaces.
- Changed SOUP_NAZI to only deny Opera-4 versions
- Moved SQSPELL_VERSION to sqspell_functions.php for easier
  upgrades.

- SquirrelSpell options are now on the main OPTIONS page, not on the
  personal options page.
