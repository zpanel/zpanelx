From version v0.2 to version v0.3
----------------------------------

The user dictionaries will be converted to v0.3 format. Once they are
converted, you can't downgrade back to v0.2. If this scares you, backup all
*.words files in your $data_dir somewhere safe.

Files are renamed around. config.php is now sqspell_config.php. 

When you are setting up SQSPELL_DEFAULT_APP in the sqspell_config, keep in 
mind that this has to reflect whichever dictionary you used in version 0.2.
Say, if you used "ispell -d german", you will need to specify German as 
your SQSPELL_DEFAULT_APP so user dictionaries can be upgraded successfully.
Otherwise wrong words will end up in a wrong dictionary.
