Installing Demo
===============

The Demo plugin comes with SquirrelMail, so you should
only need to activate it using the configuration utility.

1) Go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd config/
  $ ./conf.pl
