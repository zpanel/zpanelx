You have been warned :)

Ok, now to the good stuff. Enable this plugin as you would any other.
Its called 'info'. You will then have an "IMAP server information"  section
on your options page. This will take you to an IMAP command workshop
where you can select pre-made commands, send them to the IMAP server
and see the response. All selected commands will be run one at a time
starting with the first selected command and working down.

Commands can be modified however you like, but remember, you are
performing these commands on the account you are logged into, so
any command that changes the contents of  your mailbox will ..er..
change the contents of your mailbox :)

Changes and custom commands are maintained as long as you are on
the IMAP server options page (even after submitting tests).
Once you leave this page and return then the commmands are reset
to the defaults. You can manually reset the commands using the
'default' button, or clear the contents of all the commands with
the 'clear' button.

This plugin has been originally developed by Jason Munro and is now
maintained by the SquirrelMail Project Team.
