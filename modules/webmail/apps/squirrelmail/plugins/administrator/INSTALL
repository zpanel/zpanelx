Administrator Plugin
--------------------

In order to use this plugin, you must first activate it using
conf.pl and then you must change the config/config.php files
permissions to 660. This file must be owned by the user who you
want to have access to this plugin (only one user allowed) and
the group must be the group of the user who is running php. This 
authentication method requires posix support in php and doesn't 
work, if user's id equals to 0.

An alternative method, but less secure, is to add a file called
admins into the plugin folder with the names of the users that
you want to allow the use of the plugin.

Use this plugin at your own risk, and always remember to make a
backup of your config.php file before use. 

Order of authentication checks
------------------------------
When plugin checks if user can use it, it first checks 
plugins/administrator/admins file. If file does not exist, plugin
checks config/admins. If plugin can't find admins file, it tries to
use uid based authentication.
