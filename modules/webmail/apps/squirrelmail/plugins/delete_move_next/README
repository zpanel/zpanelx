delete_move_next -- Version 3.0
By Ben Brillat <brillat-sqplugin@mainsheet.org>

This is a modified version of Delete Move Next by Bryan Stalcup <bryan@stalcup.net>

If you read the mail in your inbox starting with the most recent, this
plugin is meant for you. It adds a set of mail management links across 
the bottom or top of the email. 

Features
========
* Saves you the need to scroll up to go to the previous or next email
* Allows you to delete the current email and view the next or previous
  message in step
* Allows you to move the current email to any mailbox and view the next


Description
===========
This plugin adds links to the message view for each message.
The links include "Previous", "Next", "Delete & Previous", and "Delete & 
Next", which deletes the current email and displays the next email. 
Also included is a menu to move the current email to any folder and 
then display the next email. It helps me keep up with my constantly 
overflowing inbox.

Future Work
===========
* You tell me...


Limitations (Known bugs)
========================
-If you delete or move an email, then use the "Message List" link at the
 top left of the header, the message list is pulled from cache, and does
 not reflect the deleted/moved email(s). To view the current list, click
 the mailbox link in the left-hand navigation bar.
-"Delete & Prev" or "Delete & Next" can result in strange behavior when
 deleting the last or next to last message in a mailbox when using any
 sort order other than 0.  It won't kill anything, you just might arrive
 at a message other than the one you were expecting to see.
 If anyone has any suggestions on this one, please let me know.
