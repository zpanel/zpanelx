All about this release
======================

This release addresses a security problem in SquirrelMail, as well
as a couple small bug fixes/improvements.

Notable changes:
 * Security fix, see below.
 * Cookies no longer sent as HTTPS-only under IIS unless the
   connection really is secure.
 * Alternate identities are correctly matched when replying
   to mesages.

Security issue
==============

An issue was fixed that allowed an attacker to send specially-
crafted hyperlinks in a message that could execute cross-site
scripting (XSS) when the user viewed the message in SquirrelMail.

We would like to thank Secunia Research for reporting this issue
to us. It is tracked as CVE-2008-2379.


Locales / Translations / Charsets
=================================

Since the release of 1.4.4, the the translations for SquirrelMail are
no longer part of the main package but have to be downloaded separately;
either in one large file or an individual language. You can find these
packages through our web site. They also contain instructions on how
to install.

That release also introduced a backport of the new Character set
decoding functions from the development branch, vastly increasing the
number of supported character sets and decoding performance.


Major updates in 1.4
====================

The 1.4.x series (as a result of 1.3 developent series) brings:

* A complete rewrite of the way we send mail (Deliver-class),
  and of the way we parse mail (MIME-bodystructure parsing).
  This makes SquirrelMail more reliable and more efficient
  at the same time!
* Support for IMAP UID which makes SquirrelMail more reliable.
* Optimizations to code and the number of IMAP calls; SquirrelMail
  is now a very scalable webmail solution.
* Support for a wider range of authentication mechanisms.
* Lots of bugfixes, some new features and a couple of UI-tweaks.
