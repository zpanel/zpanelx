All about this Release!
=======================

This is the third release of the stable 1.4.x series.  This release
added no new user features, focusing strictly on bugfixes and
performance enhancements.

See the Major Updates section of this file for more about the 
1.4.x stable series.  For changes in this release, please refer to
the ChangeLog.


A note on PHP 4.3.x
===================

While the developers realize that PHP 4.3.x is the "latest and greatest"
version of PHP to be available, SquirrelMail has not been extensively
tested with it. We currently believe that SquirrelMail should work on
PHP 4.3.x but we lack the experience with this new version to be
absolutely sure. If you want to be safe, or experience problems, you may
want to downgrade to PHP 4.2.x.


Major updates
==============

The 1.4.0 series (as a result of 1.3 developent series) brings:

* A complete rewrite of the way we send mail (Deliver-class),
  and of the way we parse mail (MIME-bodystructure parsing).
  This makes SquirrelMail more reliable and more efficient
  at the same time!
* Support for IMAP UID which makes SquirrelMail more reliable.
* Optimizations to code and the number of IMAP calls; SquirrelMail
  is now a very scalable webmail solution.
* Support for a wider range of authentication mechanisms.
* Lots of bugfixes, some new features and a couple of UI-tweaks.


A note on plugins
=================

There have been major plugin architecture improvements since 1.2.x. Lots
of plugins have not yet been adapted to this. Plugins which are
distributed with this release (eg. in the same .tar.gz file) should work.
Plugin authors will need some time to adapt their plugins, so quite a few
plugins that did work with 1.2.x might not work with 1.4.x.

So if you have ANY problem at all, first try turning off all plugins.
If one plugin seems to be the culprit, contact the author to see if
a 1.4.x version is underway.

Plugins that worked with 1.4.1 should continue to work without changes
with 1.4.2.

Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.4 bug
==========================================

We constantly aim to make SquirrelMail even better. So we need you to
submit any bug you come across! Also, please mention that the bug is
in this 1.4.2 release, and list your IMAP server and webserver details.

Thanks for your cooperation with this. That helps us to make
sure nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.
