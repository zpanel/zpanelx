All about this release
======================

This release addresses some security problems in SquirrelMail, adds
several new language translations, makes some improvements to the
filters plugin and the address book system, and addresses several
other small bug fixes and improvements.

Notable changes:
 * Security fixes - see below.
 * New languages: Bangladeshi Bengali, Khmer, Tamil

For a more complete list of changes, please see the file "ChangeLog"
in the doc/ directory.

Security issues
===============

Two issues were fixed that both allowed an attacker to run arbitrary
script (XSS) on most any SquirrelMail page by getting the user to
click on specially crafted SquirrelMail links.  We would like to thank
Niels Teusink and Christian Balzer for reporting these issues to us.
These are tracked as CVE-2009-1578.

An issue was fixed wherein input to the contrib/decrypt_headers.php
script was not sanitized and allowed arbitrary script execution upon
submission of certain values. We would like to thank Niels Teusink for
reporting this issue to us.  This is also tracked as CVE-2009-1578.

An issue was fixed that allowed arbitrary server-side code execution
when SquirrelMail was configured to use the example "map_yp_alias"
username mapping functionality.  We would like to thank Niels Teusink
for reporting this issue to us.  This is tracked as CVE-2009-1579.

An issue was fixed that allowed an attacker to possibly steal user
data by hijacking the SquirrelMail login session.  We would like to
thank Tomas Hoger for reporting this issue to us.  This is tracked
as CVE-2009-1580.

An issue was fixed that allowed phishing and cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks to be run by surreptitious placement of content in
specially-crafted emails sent to SquirrelMail users.  We would like to
thank Luc Beurton for reporting this issue to us.  This is tracked
as CVE-2009-1581.

Locales / Translations / Charsets
=================================

Since the release of SquirrelMail 1.4.4, translations are no longer
a part of the main package.  They are now downloaded separately; you
can obtain all languages in one package or get an individual language.
You can find these packages on our web site. They also contain
installation instructions.

The release of SquirrelMail 1.4.4 also introduced a backport of the
new Character set decoding functions from our development code branch,
vastly increasing the decoding performance and the number of supported
character sets.


Major updates in 1.4
====================

The 1.4.x series (as a result of 1.3 developent series) brings:

* A complete rewrite of the way we send mail (Deliver class),
  and of the way we parse mail (MIME bodystructure parsing).
  This makes SquirrelMail more reliable and more efficient
  at the same time!
* Support for IMAP UID which makes SquirrelMail more reliable.
* Optimizations to code and the number of IMAP calls; SquirrelMail
  is now a very scalable webmail solution.
* Support for a wider range of authentication mechanisms.
* Lots of bugfixes, some new features and a couple of UI-tweaks.
