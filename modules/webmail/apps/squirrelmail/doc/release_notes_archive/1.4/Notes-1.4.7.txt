All about this release
======================

This version, 1.4.7 is a maintenance release, addressing
the following problems since 1.4.6:
- Minor security fixes (see below)
- A lot of bugfixes (see ChangeLog)
- Added support for Ukrainian and some added teams
(see ChangeLog for a full list)


Locales / Translations / Charsets
=================================

Since the release of 1.4.4, the the translations for SquirrelMail are
no longer part of the main package but have to be downloaded separately;
either in one large file or an individual language. You can find these
packages through our homepage. They also contain instructions on how
to install.

That release also introduced a backport of the new Character set
decoding functions from the development branch, vastly increasing the
number of supported character sets and decoding performance.


Security issues
===============

This release addresses two different security issues found since
the release of 1.4.6, which we consider to be of minor severity,
but they have of course been fixed:

- It was possible to include a local file through functions/plugin.php with
  register_globals enabled, and magic_quotes disabled. However, running with
  register_globals enabled is completely unnecessary and a well-known security
  hazzard. We've now changed the code such that when register_globals is enabled,
  all globals are deregistered. Reported by Denix Solutions, thanks!

- It was possible to steal a cookie of a user that ran on the same base domain.
  Since this setup is already inherently insecure we don't think the impact is
  big, but the code was of course fixed to also incorporate the path to
  SquirrelMail.


Major updates
==============

The 1.4.x series (as a result of 1.3 developent series) brings:

* A complete rewrite of the way we send mail (Deliver-class),
  and of the way we parse mail (MIME-bodystructure parsing).
  This makes SquirrelMail more reliable and more efficient
  at the same time!
* Support for IMAP UID which makes SquirrelMail more reliable.
* Optimizations to code and the number of IMAP calls; SquirrelMail
  is now a very scalable webmail solution.
* Support for a wider range of authentication mechanisms.
* Lots of bugfixes, some new features and a couple of UI-tweaks.


A note on plugins
=================

There have been major plugin architecture improvements since 1.2.x. Lots
of plugins have not yet been adapted to this. Plugins which are
distributed with this release (eg. in the same .tar.gz file) should work.
Plugin authors will need some time to adapt their plugins, so quite a few
plugins that did work with 1.2.x might not work with 1.4.x.

So if you have ANY problem at all, first try turning off all plugins.
If one plugin seems to be the culprit, contact the author to see if
a 1.4.x version is underway.

Plugins that worked with previous 1.4.x versions should continue to work
without changes with this version.


Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.4 bug
==========================================

We constantly aim to make SquirrelMail even better. So we need you to
submit any bug you come across! Also, please mention that the bug is
in this 1.4.6 release, and list your IMAP server and webserver details.

Thanks for your cooperation with this. That helps us to make
sure nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.
