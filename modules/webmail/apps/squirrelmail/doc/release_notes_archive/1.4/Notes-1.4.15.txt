All about this release
======================

This release is a bugfix release for a number of issues identified since
1.4.13 was released.

Version number 1.4.14 was skipped, because some spammer decided to use this
version number in a phishing attempt.


Locales / Translations / Charsets
=================================

Since the release of 1.4.4, the the translations for SquirrelMail are
no longer part of the main package but have to be downloaded separately;
either in one large file or an individual language. You can find these
packages through our homepage. They also contain instructions on how
to install.

That release also introduced a backport of the new Character set
decoding functions from the development branch, vastly increasing the
number of supported character sets and decoding performance.



Major updates in 1.4
====================

The 1.4.x series (as a result of 1.3 developent series) brings:

* A complete rewrite of the way we send mail (Deliver-class),
  and of the way we parse mail (MIME-bodystructure parsing).
  This makes SquirrelMail more reliable and more efficient
  at the same time!
* Support for IMAP UID which makes SquirrelMail more reliable.
* Optimizations to code and the number of IMAP calls; SquirrelMail
  is now a very scalable webmail solution.
* Support for a wider range of authentication mechanisms.
* Lots of bugfixes, some new features and a couple of UI-tweaks.


A note on plugins
=================

There have been major plugin architecture improvements since 1.2.x. Lots
of plugins have not yet been adapted to this. Plugins which are
distributed with this release (eg. in the same .tar.gz file) should work.
Plugin authors will need some time to adapt their plugins, so quite a few
plugins that did work with 1.2.x might not work with 1.4.x.

So if you have ANY problem at all, first try turning off all plugins.
If one plugin seems to be the culprit, contact the author to see if
a 1.4.x version is underway.

Plugins that worked with previous 1.4.x versions should continue to work
without changes with this version.


Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.4 bug
==========================================

We constantly aim to make SquirrelMail even better. So we need you to
submit any bug you come across! Also, please mention that the bug is
in this release, and list your IMAP server and webserver details.

Thanks for your cooperation with this. That helps us to make
sure nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in our source code repository already.

Any questions about installing or using SquirrelMail can be directed
to our user support list:

things to share with the developers, join the development mailinglist:

                  Happy SquirrelMailing!
