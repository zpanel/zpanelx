All about this Release!!!
=========================

The 1.2 series is continuing to get better and more featured. The
latest added features are:

  * MDN Support - You can send and request delivery & read receipts.
  * Enhanced Search functions - search multiple folders at once,
          search history
  * And another pileful of fixes and omtimisations

See the Changelog file for details.

Being one of the most popular webmail clients, the developers of
SquirrelMail feel a huge desire and responsibility to continue push
the envelope and make SquirrelMail the best it can possibly be. You
will not be disappointed with this release, as it is by far the most
feature rich, and yet it is still the same sleek and unbloated and
cuddly webmail application that we have all grown to love. Here is
an incomplete list of new features and enhancements since the last
stable release.

  * Collapsible Folders - The folder list can be collapsed at any
          parent folder. This makes folder lists with large
          hierarchical structures much easier to manage and navigate.
  * The Paginator! - This enables quick access to any page in the
          message list by simply choosing the page number to view
          rather than tediously clicking "next" 50 times.
  * Hundreds of UI tweaks - The user interface has been given a
          face-lift. The HTML has been largely overhauled, and while
          it still has the same general feel, it has been made more
          intuitive.
  * Drafts - It is now possible to compose a message and save it to
          be sent at a later date with the drafts option.
  * New Options Page - The options page has been completely
          rewritten for several reasons, the main of which was to
          allow seamless integration of plugin options and to
          provide uniformity throughout the entire section.
  * Multiple Identities - It is now possible to create different
          identities (home, work, school) that can be chosen upon
          sending. Each identity can have its own email address,
          full name, and signature.
  * Reply Citations - Different types of citations are now possible
          when replying to messages.
  * Better Attachment Handling - The plugin, attachment_common, has
          been fully integrated into the core of SquirrelMail.  This
          allows inline viewing of several different types of
          attachments.
  * Integration of Several Plugins - The following plugins have been
          put directly into the core. As a result, be sure not to
          install these as plugins, as the result may be (at best)
          unpredictable: attachment_common, paginator, priority,
          printer_friendly, sqclock, xmailer.
  * Improved support for newer versions of PHP. Note that you may
          have trouble if you are running PHP version 4.0.100
          (commonly distributed with Debian 3.0).
  * Ability to mark messages as read and unread from the message listing.
  * Alternating Colors - The message list now alternates row colors
          by default.  This presents a much cleaner and easier to
          read interface to the user.

Aside from these obvious front end features, there are hundreds of
bugs that have been fixed, and much of the code has been optimized
and/or rewritten.  This stable release is far superior in all
aspects to all previous versions of SquirrelMail.

Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.2 bug
==========================================

Of course, in the words of Linus Torvalds, this release is officially
certified to be Bug-Free (tm).

However, if for some reason some bugs manage to find their way to the
surface, please report them at once (after all, they ARE uncertified
bugs!!!) The PROPER place to report these bugs is the SquirrelMail Bug
Tracker.

   http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs

Thank you for your cooperation in that issue. That helps us to make
sure that nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.


Important Note about PHP 4.1.0
==============================

Finally, we have managed to make *this* SquirrelMail release cooperate
nicely with the new PHP 4.1 release. As opposed to 1.2.4 and before,
which was less good friends with PHP 4.1.

So: "Yes! It works"

About our Release Aliases - by Wouter Teepe
=========================

Back with the release of 1.2.0, back when Christmas was recent, and
not the Olympics, there was this vision of structurgin the
SquirrelMail community into "Teams", all doing their own thing.

Finally, the teams have really kicked off. :-)

And, I would like to welcome all our new community members, being both
YOU, the eventful users of SquirrelMail, as well as Simon Dick, Jason
Munro, Pete Palmer and Chris Hills who have became team leads, as
well as Marc Groot Koerkamp and Thijs Kinkhorst (both just by incident
inhabitants of the same country as me :-)) who have recently joined
SquirrelMail and have made worthy contributions.

Welcome to the SquirrelMail teams.

(And now...get the Great Rewrite geared up)

                  Happy SquirrelMailing!
