All about this Release!!!
=========================

Squirrelmail.
It's feature set is that of a desktop client.
It's ease of use is unheard of.
It's ..ehem.. bug free.
There is nowhere else to go...
Except to the 1.2.6 stable version of Squirrelmail!!

    We are excited to bring you the latest and greatest Squirrelmail release 
to date. More features you say? You got it. Better performance is what
you need? Expect it. Looking for a Sqirrelmail with less bugs? It is here.
Here are some highlights:

  * Greatly improved Cross Site Scripting Protection with a new custom
    html filter.
  * Improved search and filter functions, allowing for non-ascii search
    and filter criteria.
  * Server side sorting capability to improve performance with large 
    mailboxes.
  * Most importantly, Many, many bugfixes. And more bugfixes. did I mention 
    bugfixes?

See the Changelog file for details.

   Being one of the most popular webmail clients, the developers of
SquirrelMail feel a huge desire and responsibility to continue push
the envelope and make SquirrelMail the best it can possibly be. You
will not be disappointed with this release, as it is by far the most
feature rich, and yet it is still the same sleek and unbloated and
cuddly webmail application that we have all grown to love. Here is
an incomplete list of some of the great features that Squirrelmail
has to offer:

  * Collapsible Folders - The folder list can be collapsed at any
          parent folder. This makes folder lists with large
          hierarchical structures much easier to manage and navigate.
  * Fix for the "theme passed as cookie" exploit posted to the bug-
          traq mailing list.
  * The Paginator! - This enables quick access to any page in the
          message list by simply choosing the page number to view
          rather than tediously clicking "next" 50 times.
  * Hundreds of UI tweaks - The user interface has been given a
          face-lift. The HTML has been largely overhauled, and while
          it still has the same general feel, it has been made more
          intuitive.
  * Drafts - It is now possible to compose a message and save it to
          be sent at a later date with the drafts option.
  * Ability to mark messages as read and unread from the message listing.
  * New Options Page - The options page has been completely
          rewritten for several reasons, the main of which was to
          allow seamless integration of plugin options and to
          provide uniformity throughout the entire section.
  * Multiple Identities - It is now possible to create different
          identities (home, work, school) that can be chosen upon
          sending. Each identity can have its own email address,
          full name, and signature.
  * Ability to forward messages as attachments from the message listing.
  * Reply Citations - Different types of citations are now possible
          when replying to messages.
  * Better Attachment Handling - The plugin, attachment_common, has
          been fully integrated into the core of SquirrelMail.  This
          allows inline viewing of several different types of
          attachments.
  * Integration of Several Plugins - The following plugins have been
          put directly into the core. As a result, be sure not to
          install these as plugins, as the result may be (at best)
          unpredictable: attachment_common, paginator, priority,
          printer_friendly, sqclock, xmailer.
  * Improved support for newer versions of PHP. Recommended versions
          are 4.0.3 -> 4.1.2. 
  * Server-side sorting support adds speed to the mailbox display, even
          with large mailboxes. Server-sid thread sorting support allows 
          users to display mailboxes in thread-sort order.

  
I am sure there are plenty more features I have missed. You just have
to try it for yourself!

Having been involved with Squirrelmail for a while I can safely say
that this stable release has the most bugfixes to date. The invaluable
contributions of the Squirrelmail community, from developers and users
alike have helped to make this release of Squirrelmail the best yet.

Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.2 bug
==========================================

Of course, in the words of Linus Torvalds, this release is officially
certified to be Bug-Free (tm).

However, if for some reason some bugs manage to find their way to the
surface, please report them at once (after all, they ARE uncertified
bugs!!!) The PROPER place to report these bugs is the SquirrelMail Bug
Tracker.

   http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs

Thank you for your cooperation in that issue. That helps us to make
sure that nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.


Important Note about PHP 4.2.0
==============================

  A few days before this release, PHP 4.2.0 hit the net. The Squirrelmail
team has not had a chance to test this new version of PHP with the 1.2.6
release. The recommended versions of PHP for Squirrelmail 1.2.6 is 4.0.3
through 4.1.2.


About our Release Aliases - By Jason Munro 
=========================

Squirrelmail has started on a new journey.
Two journeys really. 
  
In one, our beloved hero delves deep inside its squirrel-self, 
searching for calmness and peace with its surroundings. 
Striving to hone its squirrel-skills against any and all obstacles.

This is the stable path.

In the other, our champion has shed the failures of its past and
started anew on a wild adventure through uncharted territory. The
dangers are great, but so are the rewards.

This is the development path.


  Squirrelmail 1.2.6 is the latest stepping-stone on the stable
path. It leads to a Squirrelmail of unseen dependablity and
performance.
  Squirrelmail 2.0 development has begun. This is the first step
on the journey down the development path. New worlds of possiblity
are opening up with each step.

Forget what you thought you knew about Squirrelmail, 
and get ready for a whole new nut.


                  Happy SquirrelMailing!
