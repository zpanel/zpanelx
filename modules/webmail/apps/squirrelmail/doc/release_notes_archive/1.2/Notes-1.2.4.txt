  Note: Please see the ChangeLog for 1.2.0, 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 bugs
        that have been fixed in this 1.2.2 release.

  Note: This release is a security fix. Fixes a nasty remote
        arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the
        spellchecker plugin. Upgrading is very much recommended,
        also if you do not use that plugin.

  Note: This is not the promised PHP 4.1 fix release. This one came
        in between because of the urgency of the fix.

After a long wait, SquirrelMail is finally making a new major stable
series release. The past year has been ANYTHING but uneventful for
the SquirrelMail Project. This year has seen two leadership changes,
the release of the 1.0 series, the 1.1 development series, and now
finally the much awaited 1.2 release.

All about this Release!!!
=========================

Being one of the most popular webmail clients, the developers of
SquirrelMail feel a huge desire and responsibility to continue push
the envelope and make SquirrelMail the best it can possibly be. You
will not be disappointed with this release, as it is by far the most
feature rich, and yet it is still the same sleek and unbloated and
cuddly webmail application that we have all grown to love. Here is
an incomplete list of new features and enhancements since the last
stable release.

  * Collapsible Folders - The folder list can be collapsed at any
          parent folder. This makes folder lists with large
          hierarchical structures much easier to manage and navigate.
  * The Paginator! - This enables quick access to any page in the
          message list by simply choosing the page number to view
          rather than tediously clicking "next" 50 times.
  * Hundreds of UI tweaks - The user interface has been given a
          face-lift. The HTML has been largely overhauled, and while
          it still has the same general feel, it has been made more
          intuitive.
  * Drafts - It is now possible to compose a message and save it to
          be sent at a later date with the drafts option.
  * New Options Page - The options page has been completely
          rewritten for several reasons, the main of which was to
          allow seamless integration of plugin options and to
          provide uniformity throughout the entire section.
  * Multiple Identities - It is now possible to create different
          identities (home, work, school) that can be chosen upon
          sending. Each identity can have its own email address,
          full name, and signature.
  * Reply Citations - Different types of citations are now possible
          when replying to messages.
  * Better Attachment Handling - The plugin, attachment_common, has
          been fully integrated into the core of SquirrelMail.  This
          allows inline viewing of several different types of
          attachments.
  * Integration of Several Plugins - The following plugins have been
          put directly into the core. As a result, be sure not to
          install these as plugins, as the result may be (at best)
          unpredictable: attachment_common, paginator, priority,
          printer_friendly, sqclock, xmailer.
  * Improved support for newer versions of PHP. Note that you may
          have trouble if you are running PHP version 4.0.100
          (commonly distributed with Debian 3.0).
  * Ability to mark messages as read and unread from the message listing.
  * Alternating Colors - The message list now alternates row colors
          by default.  This presents a much cleaner and easier to
          read interface to the user.

Aside from these obvious front end features, there are hundreds of
bugs that have been fixed, and much of the code has been optimized
and/or rewritten.  This stable release is far superior in all
aspects to all previous versions of SquirrelMail.

Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.2 bug
==========================================

Of course, in the words of Linus Torvalds, this release is officially
certified to be Bug-Free (tm).

However, if for some reason some bugs manage to find their way to the
surface, please report them at once (after all, they ARE uncertified
bugs!!!) The PROPER place to report these bugs is the SquirrelMail Bug
Tracker.

   http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs

Thank you for your cooperation in that issue. That helps us to make
sure that nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.


Important Note about PHP 4.1.0
==============================

First of all, let me say that you all HAVE been warned: the
SquirrelMail Project Team is not supporting PHP 4.1.0 for the 1.2.0
release. Basically, SquirrelMail was in the final death throws of
this development series when the witty PHP folks decided to make the
release of 4.1.0. Of course, we greatly appreciate their hard work! :)

However, we were too close to the end of this whole thing to be able
to spend the week or two EXTRA that it will take to get SquirrelMail
1.2 PHP 4.1.0 ready. This will, on the bright side, be a major
priority amongst the team in the immediate future. At first look, it
seems that 4.1.0 support should just require a collection of
relatively minor tweaks. You can expect 4.1.0 support within 2-3
weeks, as a part of a later 1.2.X release.


Where are we going from here?
=============================

After things cool down a bit and the smoke clears from 1.2,
progress will begin on the Great SquirrelMail Rewrite, also known as
the 1.3 development branch. This branch will eventually become the
long talked about SquirrelMail 2.0. The major developmental emphasis
for SquirrelMail 2.0 will be in making SquirrelMail more flexible
and modular so that it might do a better job meeting the needs of
our system administrators and end-users. We are greatly anticipating
working in this area.

At the same time, we will kick start the SquirrelMail Teams. For
some time now, we have been planning a reorganization of the project
into a variety of sub-teams. Each sub-team will focus on a different
aspect of SquirrelMail Project work. These teams will hopefully help
keep the SquirrelMail project more on track and to provide some
semblance of order. This project has grown so large in the past two
years that an orderly structure is necessary if anything is to get
done effectively. The teams (as planned) are as follows:

   Stable Series Team:      Maintains the stable series
   Development Series Team: Works on the development series
   i18n Team:               Handles i18n (internationalization) work
   Plugin Team:             Manages the mass of plugins
   User Support Team:       Helps users with their problems
   Documentation Team:      Manages the documentation
   Evangelism Team:         Spreads the good news of SquirrelMail

Teams will be led by one or two SquirrelMail team members. And team
members can participate in as many teams as he or she desires.

For the next few weeks, the developers will be working on bug-fixing
and making the 1.2 series rock solid. After that, about mid January,
focus will shift toward getting the teams in gear and starting work
on the SquirrelMail 1.3 development series.


About our Release Aliases - by Wouter Teepe
=========================

Malfoy's house elf had been saying "Bad hole, bad hole", for a change
to "Bad Dobby, bad Dobby". Konstantin lent him a sock. Although
Konstantin is not Malfoy, the sock fitted over the hole, and we were
all pleased. Even Dobby stopped crying.

Enough Potterese. We're glad we fixed the hole.
