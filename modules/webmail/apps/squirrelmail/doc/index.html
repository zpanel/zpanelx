<h1>SquirrelMail Documentation</h1>

<p>Below is a list of all the documentation that comes in the SquirrelMail
distribution package. Some of it may not be as up to date as what you'll
find in our online manuals, which have better and more current information.
We have manuals for administrators, developers, translators and users.
There is also plenty of content that has been contributed by the community
on our wiki.  Links to all these manuals and wikis can be found on our
<a href="http://squirrelmail.org/documentation">documentation page</a></p>
