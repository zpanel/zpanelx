All about this release
======================

This release contains a large number of performance
enhancements, stability fixes and a few bug/security fixes.

The most important thing to note when upgrading to version
1.4.22 is that due to a fix made that standardizes the folder
list display, administrators who had their configuration file
set to work around this issue in the past will need to update
their configuration.  This will commonly affect those using
Courier IMAP, but could affect others as well.

If you have $default_sub_of_inbox set to FALSE in your main
configuration (or, using the configuration tool, see
"3. Folder Defaults" ===> "12. Default Sub. of INBOX"),
and you find after upgrade that your special folders (e.g.,
Trash, Drafts, Sent) are no longer listed at the top of your
folder list, please change that value to TRUE.

Also, if you find that this upgrade prevents users from
logging in with an error such as "ERROR: Could not complete
request.  Query: CREATE "Trash" Reason Given: Invalid mailbox
name.", you will need to correct the user preference values
for the problem folders.  You can do so with commands such as
the following for file-based preferences (adjust the data
directory location as needed):

   find /var/lib/squirrelmail/data/ -name *.pref -exec sed --in-place 's/trash_folder=Trash/trash_folder=INBOX.Trash/g' {} \;
   find /var/lib/squirrelmail/data/ -name *.pref -exec sed --in-place 's/trash_folder=Drafts/trash_folder=INBOX.Drafts/g' {} \;
   find /var/lib/squirrelmail/data/ -name *.pref -exec sed --in-place 's/trash_folder=Sent/trash_folder=INBOX.Sent/g' {} \;

Or, for database-based preferences:

   UPDATE userprefs SET prefval = 'INBOX.Trash' WHERE prefkey = 'trash_folder' AND prefval = 'Trash';
   UPDATE userprefs SET prefval = 'INBOX.Drafts' WHERE prefkey = 'draft_folder' AND prefval = 'Drafts';
   UPDATE userprefs SET prefval = 'INBOX.Sent' WHERE prefkey = 'sent_folder' AND prefval = 'Sent';

MAKE SURE to back up your user preferences before doing any
of the above!

For a complete list of changes, please see the file "ChangeLog"
in the doc/ directory.


Security issues
===============

This release also addresses several security issues, including
some harsh but hard to exploit XSS bugs, a general clickjacking
vulnerability, and a small problem with message santizing.

If only for the clickjacking protection, we recommend that
users of previous versions of SquirrelMail upgrade at their
earliest convenience.

For a more detailed discussion of the security fixes in this
version, please see the listings for CVE-2010-4554, CVE-2010-4555,
and CVE-2011-2023 at http://squirrelmail.org/security/


Locales / Translations / Charsets
=================================

Translations are not a part of the main SquirrelMail package.  They
are downloaded separately; you can obtain all languages in one
package or get an individual language.  You can find these packages
on our web site.  They also contain installation instructions.
