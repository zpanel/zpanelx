HOW TO CONFIGURE SQUIRRELMAIL WITH RUSSIAN APACHE
--------------------------------------------------

It is no longer advised to try and make SquirrelMail live in peace with
RussianApache. Too many problems arise trying to make charset recoding
co-exist with SquirrelMail. SM is completely capable of providing necessary
charset headers, so most modern browsers will not have any problems 
interacting with SquirrelMail in the necessary Charset.

To turn off Charset Recoding of Russian Apache, use the following
directive:

CharsetDisable on

You may put this directive into VirtualHost, Directory, Location, or
a .htaccess file in the SquirrelMail's main directory (unless you
turned off .htaccess files).

This is the best solution so far -- others involve so many steps that
they are no longer viable.

If you have any questions or problems, please address them to
the squirrelmail-users@lists.sourceforge.net to have them 
promptly answered. ;)
