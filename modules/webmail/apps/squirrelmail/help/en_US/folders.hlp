      Folders
   </title>   
   <summary>
      You can store messages in different folders.  This is
      especially useful if you have a lot of email and want
      to keep it organized.  The folders option allows
      manipulation of your folders.

      Subscribed Folders and the Left Frame
   </title>
   <description>
      <p>
      Currently subscribed folders are listed in the colored 
      area to the left.  This frame may be set to automatically 
      refresh in the Options page.  At the top of the left 
      frame is large and bolded heading.  If changes have been 
      made to the subscribed folders using the folders menu 
      item, this list can be refreshed with the link below the 
      title.  Oddly enough, this link is titled "refresh folder 
      list".
      </p><p>
      The first folder listed contains received mail.  To the 
      right of the first folder is a number in parentheses
      "( )" reflecting the count of <i>unread</i> emails.
      This number is likely to vary from the total number 
      of emails displayed in the right frame.  Under the main 
      folder are likely to be other folders or subfolders.
      Colors for these folders will change with theme choices 
      made in the options page.

   </title>
   <description>
      <p>
      You may delete any folder displayed in the drop down list box to 
      the left of the Delete button.  Notice that this list may <b>not</b> 
      include all the folders displayed.  The special folders such as 
      your sent or your trash folder cannot be deleted, and of course,
      you cannot delete INBOX.

      Create
   </title>
   <description>
      <p>
      Folders may be created by simply typing the desired name into the 
      text box and pressing the Create button.  If you wish that this folder
      be a subfolder of another one, you can choose that in the drop-down
      box with the list of folders.
      </p>
      <p>
      On some mail servers, there are two types of folders.
      One that contains messages, and one that 
      contains folders.  You may see an option called "Let this folder contain
      subfolders."  If you do and you check that, the folder you create will
      only be able to contain folders and not any messages.  Otherwise, you 
      will only be able to store messages in it and not folders.

      Rename
   </title>
   <description>
      <p>
      You may rename any folder displayed in the drop down list box to the 
      left of the Rename button.  Notice that this list may <b>not</b> 
      include all the folders displayed in the left frame.  For obvious
      reasons, you cannot rename the sent, trash, or INBOX folders.

      Unsubscribe and Subscribe
   </title>
   <description>
      Definitions:<br />
      <i>Subscribe</i>: To register a folder with the mail server, allowing 
                        you to view it in the folder listings.<br />
      <i>Unsubscribe</i>: The opposite of subscribing.  This unregisters a
                        folder with the mail server.<br />
      <br /><p>
      You may choose as many folders as you wish from either the subscribe
      or the unsubscribe box, then click the button under the box to make
      the action take effect.  You will notice that the folders move to the
      other box.  You can then re-subscribe to them, or unsubscribe again 
      as you wish.
