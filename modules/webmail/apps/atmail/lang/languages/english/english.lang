# Atmail Language File
#

# English Language File by Ben Duncan (ben@calacode.com) and Corey Bissaillon for
# Atmail version 4.52

# Javascript messages are mostly prepended with a
# js
#
# After the javascript messages a newline is placed and normal
# html messages are there again.
#
# Javascript Messages cannot contain single or double quotes.
# If you must use these characters consider using a backslash
# before these characters like \'quoted text\', \"double quoted text\"
#
# variable names can ONLY contain alphanumeric characters and the
# underscore.
#
# Many of the variables include other variables from other parts of Atmail
# like $pref['etc'], $this->etc and $var['etc']. Please consider keeping
# these. Some vars also contain HTML source code like <a etc></a> <b></b>
# please keep the formatting
