Thanks to firemail, spluffer and ikaney from forums.atmail.org for helping supply 
code for several bug fixes and new features as listed below.

- Quota display when mail server supports it and account has quota set
- Alert when over specific percentage of quota used
- Use IMAP sort extension rather than client side sort if server supports it
- Display LDAP addresses in Addressbook rather than Search->Import->Add
- Use LDAP addresses in auto complete
- Remove rogue save button on edit group page which made groups into users
- Firefox always display scrollbars (no shifts to the left on scrollable pages)
- When adding entries from LDAP server, use first and last name correctly

To enable/disable above features, edit your Config.php and change or add the following entries:

  'addressbook_ldap_entries' => '1' // show ldap entries in main addressbook
  'autocomplete_ldap_entries'  => '1' // use ldap entries when performing auto complete
  'imap_sort_extension'  => '1' // use imap sort extension where servers support it
  'imap_sort_charset' => 'us-ascii' // Charset to use for IMAP SORT command
  'quota_bar'  => '1' //display quota bar for users
  'quota_alert'  => '1' // display alert if percentage used goes over value below
  'quota_alert_over' => '90' // percentage level for quota alert to appear at
  'quota_alert_html' => '' // html printed for quota alert above dismiss link
