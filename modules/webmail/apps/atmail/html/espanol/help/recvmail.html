	<p><u>How do I block mail from a specific sender?</u>
	 <p> <ul>
		<li>By blocking someone's email address you will prevent any mail sent from him or her to reach you when you use @Mail Webmail.  To block an address you have to:<br><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the "Block Email address/Spammers" section situated on the "Folders" page.
				<li>Enter the address in the "Enter email address to block" field.
				<li>Click "Add Email".
			</ol><br>
		<li>The address will then appear on the list of blocked addresses. You can also block any email with a particular subject, Steps are similar to the above ones.
	  </ul>
	  <p><u>What is the largest message I can receive?</u> 
	  <p>With an @Mail email account, you can receive and send messages up to $pref['max_msg_size'] MB. Therefore, the total encoded size of the email message you are sending cannot exceed $pref['max_msg_size'] MB. 
	  <p><b>NOTE:</b> When attaching files to your email message, they must be encoded and in doing so, will increase in size. The attachments sent with email have to be translated into a different format so that other email programs can read it. This type of transformation will add about 33% to the original size of the attachment. Therefore, due to the translation a 2MB attachment may turn into a 2.66MB email after encoding.
