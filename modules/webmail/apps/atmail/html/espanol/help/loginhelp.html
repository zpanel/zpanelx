	<p>To log into your @Mail account, or to access an external account using the @Mail Client, you will need to provide a Username and password, and select the interface type and your language preference.  Optionally for External Access using the @Mail client, you may need to provide the mailserver name.</p>

	<p><b>Username</b>: This is commonly a personal identifier with your mail server, for example the user, Jim has an email account with isp.com, his email address is:  jim@isp.com</p>

	<p><b>Password</b>: A secret key that identifies you as authorised to login using the email account.  If you forget your password, or wish to change it click the 'Change Password' link on the login page</p>

	<p><b>Language</b>: You can select which language to use the WebMail interface for.</p>
