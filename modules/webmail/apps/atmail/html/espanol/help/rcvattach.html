        <p><u>Why can't I view the attachment? </u>
        <p>Firstly, if you cannot view the attachment from the currently location, you should first try saving the attachment to your hard drive first and then attempt to view it from there. If this method doesn't work, see below.
        <p>As every attachment you receive is a specific type of file, for example documents are ".doc" and images can be ".jpg" files you may have problems viewing the file as your browser may not be configured to support that type of file. One way to deal with this problem is to upgrade your browser.
        <p><u>What is virus? </u>
        <p>Virus is a kind of programme invading your computer system when you have not noticed. Malicious attackers spread virus to numerous computers. The most common way to spread virus is through email.
        <p>Virus can replicate and spread on its own, so the influence can be big and bad.
