        <p><u>Why can't I view the attachment? </u>
        <p>Firstly, if you cannot view the attachment from the current location, you should first try saving the attachment to your hard drive and then attempt to view it from there. If this method doesn't work, see below.
        <p>Since every attachment you receive is a specific type of file, for example documents are ".doc" and images can be ".jpg" files you may have problems viewing the file if your browser is not configured to support that type of file. One way to deal with this problem is to upgrade your browser.
        <p><u>What is a virus? </u>
        <p>A virus is a program which replicates itself,  infecting your computer much like the biological organisms of the same name. Malicious attackers can use viruses for a number of nefarious purposes. The most common method of distributing viruses is through email.
        <p>Viruses can spread on their own once activated, and their effects are often disruptive and destructive.

        <p><u>How can I do the virus scanning?</u>
        <p>You don't need to take any action if you have subscribed to the service, because the Atmail Anti-Virus Scanner automatically intercepts viruses on the server side.</td>
