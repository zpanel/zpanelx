	<p><u>How can I add an attachment to a message? </u>
	<p>To attach files to your email messages, do the following:	<p><ol>
	<li>First click the Attach button in the compose screen. 
	<li>A new window will popup to add attachments; click the "Browse" button to select a file from your hard drive
	<li>Click "OK" when you have selected the appropriate file attachment.
	<li> Once files are uploaded, you can check the size of the attachment or choose to delete the file.
	</ol>
	<p><i>NOTE:</i> When attaching files to your email message, they must be encoded and in doing so, will increase in size. The attachments sent with email have to be translated into a different format so that other email programs can read it. This type of transformation will add about 33% to the original size of the attachment. Therefore, due to the translation a 2MB attachment may turn into a 2.66MB email after encoding.
