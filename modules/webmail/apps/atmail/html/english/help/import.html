  To import an address book you will need the date to be in CSV file format. CSV stands for Comma Separated Values, and would look similar to:</font></p>
<P><strong>First Name,Last Name,Name,E-mail Address,Home Street,Home City,....</strong></p>
<P>If your importing your address book from another email client such as Outlook, you can export your address data to CSV within this program.</p>
<P>For example if you would like to import an address book from Outlook Express, you would take the following steps.</p>
<ul><P>1: In Outlook, visit File --&gt; Export --&gt; Address Book.</p>
<P>2: You will then have the option to select what sort of format you would like the export to convert to.</p>
<P>Select &quot;Text File (Comma Separated Values)&quot;</p>

<P>3: You will then have the option to store the CSV file somewhere on your computer. Select the browser button to find a suitable place and name the file. </p>
<P>4: You can now select which data from your address book you would like to import into your WebMail. Click &quot;Finish&quot; when your done.</p>

</p>
<P>5: Your address book CSV should now be successfully completed. Now return to the WebMail interface.</p>
<P>Visit the Address Book function and select the below button &quot;Import&quot;. Fill in the necessary information.</p>
</font></ul> 
<p><strong>First row contains CSV column description: </strong>Most CSV files, including files created via Outlook, contain the column descriptions. If your not sure, you can check if your CSV contains the headings by opening the file in Notepad.</p>

<P>Click on the &quot;browse&quot; button from the Address Import book and select the CSV file you created. Then click &quot;Import File&quot; and your almost there!</p>
 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Condensed" size="2"> <strong><a name="filters"></a>Selecting corresponding fields</strong></font>&nbsp;[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]<br><br> Here you can select which fields from your CSV match with the WebMail address book fields.</p>
<ul><img src="imgs/help/export3.gif" width="300" height="119"></ul></p>
<P>WebMail will try to find the best match, however if its not correct you can change it via each fields drop down menu.</font></p>
<P>If there is a field with &quot;Select&quot; it means that WebMail was unable to find data for this field. This may be because it was not included in your CSV. It won't affect the export or cause any problems, as long as the Email address field is correctly linked up.</font></p>
<P>Once your done, click &quot;Export&quot;.
  </font></p>
<P>If successful you will be notified of the number of new contacts, then be directed to your newly updated Address book.
