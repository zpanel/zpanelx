<ul>
<li>Increase the performance of the WebMail interface by configuring your browser to cache the HTML/images. Visit the Internet-Options -> Temporary Internet Files -> Settings -> Check for newer versions of stored pages = "Automatically" .</li>
<li> You can open up a context menu by right-clicking on a message. It is a much easier way to Reply, Forward, or Open a message.</li>
<li>Cannot remember the recipients for an email? Easy - you can add recipients directly from the address book with the "Add Recipients" button. If enabled on the server, you can also view shared and global address-books on the system.</li>

<!-- if($pref['allow_LDAP'] && extension_loaded('ldap')) { -->
<li>Want to use addresses on other LDAP servers? No problem - you can do this in the <b>Find People</b> window, where you can specify the LDAP server you want to query, along with the parameters you want your search to be limited to.</li>
<!-- } -->
<li>Did you know that you can click and drag messages from one folder to another? Just drag an email message to the destination folder if using the Ajax interface. For the Advanced IE interface you can click the message icon and drag to the folder tree on the left - this is a much easier way of moving your messages.</li>
