	<p><ol>
	<li>Click on the link "External Login" in the login page
	<li>On the login page that will appear, enter the <b>full address details</b> of the Mailserver that is hosting your email. For example mail.yourdomain.com, pop3.yourdomain.com, mail.ispserver.com, etc. To find the correct mail-server address check your desktop client settings for the hostname or contact your ISP for further details.
	<li>Input your username and password
	<li>Click on "Login"
