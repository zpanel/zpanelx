DISPLAY HOOKS OVERVIEW

    Display hooks are scattered throught the templates and XHTML output
    functions. They allow a plugin to insert XHTML into the existing Hastymail
    pages. Output should be built into a string then returned from the
    function that is associated with the hook. Some display hooks are on every
    page, while others are specific, such as only on the options page.
    Available display hooks are listed in index.php. Removing a hook name from
    that array will effectively disable any plugins attempt to use it without
    disabling the entire plugin.  


DISPLAY HOOKS DETAIL

    To use display hooks add the hook name to the display_hooks section of the
    plugin definition array in the config.php file for the plugin. Create a
    file called display.php if it does not exsist, and add a function called
    <plugin_name>_<display hook name>. The XHTML returned from this function
    will be inserted into the page XHTML at the hook point.
