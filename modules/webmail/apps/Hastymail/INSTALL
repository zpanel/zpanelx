1. Introduction

    Hastymail is written in PHP, which does not require compilation.
    because of this you don't need to run "make" or "make install" but
    there are just a few specific steps to get Hastymail up and running.
    Some Hastymail specific directories that need to be created with the
    correct permissions, and you will need to create a hastymail2.conf file
    from the supplied hastymail2.conf.example file. Then you need to edit
    the options in this file for your site. Finally you need to run the
    hastymail installation script that will parse your configuration file
    into an optimized version that hastymail will use. Any time you change
    the .conf file you will need to rerun the configuration script to
    generate a new optimized .rc version.

2. Requirements

    Hastymail requires only a web server with PHP support. Apache is preferred but
    not required. If PHP5 is available Hastymail will take advantage of the
    additional features is provides. Hastymail should run fine on versions of
    PHP4 going back to version 4.3. Character set handling is greatly improved
    if the PHP build has the mbstring extension. Hastymail will also use the
    iconv extension to aid in character set translation if it is available.

 3. Installation

    These instructions assumes that you have full access to the
    server hastymail is being installed on.

    1. create directories and files

        a.  Start by unpacking the Hastymail code from the gzipped tar file:

            tar zxvf hastymail2.tgz

            This will create a directory called "hastymail2".

        b.  In this directory is a file called hastymail2.conf.example. Move
            this file out of the hastymail2 directory and rename it
            hastymail2.conf. On Unix like system a good place to store this file
            is /etc/hastymail2/. This is the "human readable" version of the
            Hastymail config file. Example Unix commands:

            mkdir /etc/hastymail2
            mv hastymail2/hastymail2.conf.example /etc/hastymail2/hastymail2.conf

        b.  Move the hastymail2 directory to your web-server document root. 
            You can rename the directory to anything you want. Assuming
            the web-server document root is "/var/www/" the following
            would be the Unix command to move and rename the directory

            mv /place_you_unpacked_the_tarball/hastymail2 /var/www/webmail

        c.  Create the attachments and settings directories. This must
            be writable by the user your web-server software runs as. On
            Unix like systems a good place for these directories is in
            /var/hastymail/. Assuming the web-server runs as the user "nobody"
            the following Unix commands will setup the required directories:

            mkdir /var/hastymail2
            mkdir /var/hastymail2/attachments
            mkdir /var/hastymail2/user_settings
            mkdir /var/hastymail2/serializer_cache
            chown nobody /var/hastymail2/*

            Note that Hastymail supports using a database to store user
            settings and contacts in which case the user_settings directory
            is not required. See the hastymail2.conf.example file for more
            information on using a database with Hastymail.

            Hastymail tries to keep attachments uploaded to the server that
            never get sent cleaned up but failing to logout can leave unsent
            attachments on the server. Setting up a periodic job to delete
            files older than a certain age would be a good idea.  On UNIX
            like systems a cron job executing the following would be sufficient:

                find /var/hastymail2/attachments/ -cmin +360 -type f -exec rm -rf '{}' \; > /dev/null 2>&1

            The above command will delete any file in the attachments dir that is
            older than 6 hours.

        That's it for files and directories. You will need to enter the
        locations of the settings directory, attachments, and hastymail2
        code into the hastymail2.conf file in the next step.

    2. Edit your hastymail2.conf to suit your site

        Edit the hastymail2.conf file (in the example Unix commands above this
        file was put in /etc/hastymail2/) to match your site information.
        Update the correct values for everything in the "General" section
        as well as the SMTP and IMAP server sections. Hastymail has many
        options, most are set to reasonable defaults but read through the
        comments to be sure everything is compatible with your site and
        behaves the way you expect.
        
    3. Run the cli or web based install script to build the hastymail2.rc file

        CLI version:

        Once you have edited the hastymail2.conf file you need to use the
        install_config.php script to create the optimized version that
        hastymail will use. Lets assume the hastymail code has bee placed
        in /var/www/webmail/ and the hastymail2.conf file is in /etc/hastymail2/.
        Invoking the installation script would then be the following:
        
        php /var/www/webmail/install_scripts/install_config.php /etc/hastymail2/hastymail2.conf /etc/hastymail2/hastymail2.rc

        This will create the file hastymail2.rc which is the optimized config
        file hastymail will use.
        
        - the install_config.php file is a command line php program. Your server
          must have PHP cli support (most do). The file must have executable
          permissions set to run.

        Web version:

        The web version of the install script is at 
        hastymail2/install_scripts/web_install_config.php Load this file in
        your browser and you will be prompted to upload your hastymail2.conf
        file. When submitted the script will generate a hastymail2.rc file to
        be used with Hastymail.  There is a version of web install script at
        hastymail.org you can use to build the rc file available here:

        http://www.hastymail.org/web_install_config.php

        Once installation is complete you should remove the install_scripts
        directory from the hastymail2 source.

        
    4. Move the hastymail2.rc file to the right place and test

        IMPORTANT: The expected location of the hastymail2.rc file is:

        /etc/hastymail2/hastymail2.rc

        if you want the file to be somewhere else then edit the index.php file
        in the top level directory of the hastymail source. After the initial
        comments you will see these lines:

        /* configuration file */
        $hm2_config = '/etc/hastymail2/hastymail2.rc';

        Try to login. If you experience problems at this point please see the
        troubleshooting section 3 Resources in this document.

    1. Troubleshooting

        Server configurations vary greatly and troubleshooting a webmail
        application can get complicated fast. The best way to troubleshoot
        complex systems is to start with simple procedures that narrow
        down the source of the problem. Here are some tips for getting
        through some common problems getting webmail software up and
        running. 

        - PHP. Is PHP installed and functional? A good way to find out is
          to create an "info.php" file with the following single line of
          code:
            
            <?php phpinfo(); ?>

          Place this file in your web-server document root then load it
          into your browser. If you DON'T get a nicely formatted page
          with a ton of information about your PHP installation chances
          are something in your PHP/Web server setup is broken

        - Filesystem permissions. Web server software needs to be able
          to write to certain directories, and on UNIX like systems may
          NOT be able to write to newly created directories by default.
          If you are having problems with attachment uploading or saving
          user settings this is a common cause.

        - Mail server log files. If you have access to your mail server
          log files it is a very handy source of clues regarding what
          can be going wrong. If you believe Hastymail is configured
          correctly but you can't login with a valid username and
          password check the IMAP server log files to see if an attempt
          was made. You may have to adjust your IMAP server debug
          or log settings to get useful information. When problems occur
          sending mail check the SMTP server log files for possible
          reasons.

        - Do other clients work? Hastymail is basically an email client
          with web pages as an interface. The fact that it runs on a web
          server does not make it any less a client. A practical way
          to determine if your system is setup correctly is to attempt
          to login to a valid IMAP account with another Email client,
          any respectable (or popular but NOT respectable) client
          will do. If you can't login with another client then fixing
          your mail server software needs to be addressed before
          trying to get Hastymail to run.

        - Try the Hastymail debug options. Hastymail has several debug
          options that address specific situations. These are conf file
          settings that default to false but when enabled will output
          debug information below the hastymail interface.
            
            - show_imap_debug
                This setting makes Hastymail output all the IMAP
                commands and server responses.

            - show_full_debug
                This requires that show_imap_debug is enabled. When
                set to true Hastymail will show additional debug info
                regarding the imap server and include the complete IMAP
                server response to every command. Use with caution because
                this can output a lot of data.

            - show_cache_usage
                While not so useful for general purpose troubleshooting this
                option shows the approximate amount of IMAP account information
                being cached by Hastymail in the PHP session.

            - db_debug
                If you have Hastymail configured to use a database and are
                experiencing problems set this to true to output db related
                debug information.

        - Double check your .conf file. Keep in mind that changing the
          hastymail2.conf file DOES NOT MAKE THOSE CHANGES LIVE. You MUST
          re-run one of the configuration scripts to create the hastymail2.rc
          file for your changes to be used in Hastymail. Because we cache
          certain data for performance reasons it is also recommended that you
          logout and then back into the interface after you have changed the
          hastymail2.rc file.

        - It was discovered the some hardened PHP installations will add additional
          limits to POST forms, not just the total size of the form, but additionally
          how many elements it can contain. The folder management page of hastymail has
          a form that can get very large, depending on how many folders you have, and
          it could trigger a problem with these restrictions. It was specifically noted
          that the default suhosin PHP hardening patch values for suhosin.post.max_vars
          and suhosin.request.max_vars could become an issue with accounts that have more
          than 50 folders.

        - It is possible in PHP to overload the str* functions with multibyte string
          functions by setting the mbstring.func_overload php.ini setting. This may
          seem like a good idea but the default behavior of the mbstring functions differs
          and can cause Hastymail to output a bunch of warnings. Disabling this in the php.ini
          or with an .htaccess file solves this issue.

    2. Advanced configuration options

        Hastymail has a lot of options in the configuration file, many of which
        are for specific special circumstances and in general don't need to be
        changed. Be sure to check out all options and descriptions in that file
        to see if what you want to tweak is already available.

        If you don't find what you are looking for the next stop is the
        index.php file in the top level directory of the Hastymail source code.
        All requests in Hastymail go through this file, and it primarily
        contains array and variable definitions for the different options and
        defaults in Hastymail that are not a part of the configuration file
        system. Keep in mind this file is a PHP code file so a single
        misplaced character can cause the entire application to fail. Be sure
        you know what you are doing if you alter it.

        Hastymail supports a powerful theme and template system that can allow
        a site to make custom modifications without having to worry about breaking
        core code. PHP based templates and comprehensive use of CSS make it
        easy to add custom modifications and designs to the interface.

        Lastly Hastymail supports an evolving plugin API that allows add-on
        code to interact with Hastymail internal data and alter or add to the
        UI. Using this system it is possible to add custom features while still
        maintaining easy upgrades to the core code when new versions are released.
