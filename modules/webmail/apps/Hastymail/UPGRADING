FROM 1.1 RC1 to 1.1 RC2
---------------------

No changes


FROM 1.0/1.0.1 to 1.1 RC1
---------------------

- Changed the default HTML filter to HTMLPure which is a bit slower than
  htmLawed but more secure. To get the best performance make sure the
  pure_serializer_path value is set to a writable directory in the main
  index.php file.
- Added a new config setting called no_simplemode_cookies that disables
  cookies when user's login via simple mode (this was the previous default
  behavior). Now the default is to use cookies in simple mode.
- Added two new themes, "Clean" and "Dark Gray". These can be enabled by
  adding the following to your hastymail2.conf file:

    theme = clean,true,true,true
    theme = dark_gray,true,true,false

- Added 4 new plugins, ldap_mailhost, message_tags, spam_folder, select_range.
  Each plugin has a README file in hastymail2/plugin/<name>/ with more details.
- Added support for opening attachments types that are natively supported by
  the browser (like PDF files) either inline or in a new window. The mime
  types to support are defined in the main index.php file


ROM RC9 to 1.0
-------------------

- Added a new theme called "moss". It should be added to the hastymail.conf
  file with the following: theme=moss,true,true,false
- Added a "show_smtp_debug" setting. This will output SMTP debug information
  at the bottom of the webpage when an outgoing message is sent.
- Added a "trim_login_fields" setting. This will cause Hastymail to trim
  whitespace from usernames and passwords when a user attempts to login.
  Unlike prior releases this behavior is now disabled by default.
- Added an "imap_use_namespaces" setting. This enables the use of the IMAP
  NAMESPACE extension to determine available folders. This is a new feature
  and is disabled by default.
- Added 5 new plugins, login_alias, pop_fetch, saved_search, username, and
  custom_reply_to
- Updated the default user settings section at the bottom of the config file
  to include all available settings.


FROM RC8 to RC9
---------------

- None of the changes in these versions require any configuration updates


FROM RC7 to RC8
---------------

- Added the http_content_type setting that when changed to xhmtl will send the
  application/xhtml-xml content header
- Fixed a typo in the imap_folder_delimiter_override option.
- Changed the imap_search_charset setting options to be uppercase
- Added several (commented out) plugin entries so that all the plugins are listed.
  Newly added plugins are auto_address, js_help, js_notice, js_sign, context,
  uuencode, and quota

 
FROM RC6 to RC7
---------------

- Moved the filesystem_delim setting to the index.php file because we need to
  use it before we have access to the site config values. If you were using
  this option in the hastymail2.conf file you will need to set it to the correct
  delimiter in the main index.php file instead. The default is still "/"
- Expanded the alt_<nunmber> options in the configuration file to override any
  setting, not just IMAP related settings. This way different IMAP server logins
  can have different SMTP server settings, or different general settings.
- Added icons for the main menu to the buuf theme which requires templates, and
  the theme's entry in the hastymail2.conf file needs to be updated to the following:

    theme = buuf,true,true,true
