This plugin adds support for downloading uuencoded attachments.
To enable this plugin add the following to your hastymail2.conf file
and re-run the install_config.php script:

plugin = uuencode

If uuencode attachments are found in a message they will be displayed in the
parts section of the message view just like mime attachments. Because
uuencoded attachments don't supply any file type information only download
links are provided.
