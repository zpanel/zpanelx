This select_range plugin adds javascript to pages with message lists that
provides more convinient ways to select multiple messages. This first
release has only one mode, "shift_click", which is similar to desktop apps
that use shift to select multiple list items. To use it select a message in
the list, then hold shift and select another. All the messages between the
first and second will be selected.

To enable this plugin add or uncomment the following in your hastymail2.conf
file then rebuild and reinstall your hastymail2.rc file.

plugin = select_range

You must logout then back in to Hastymail2 for your changes to take effect.
