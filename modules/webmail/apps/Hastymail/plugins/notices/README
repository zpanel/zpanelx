notices is a plugin that will let users setup a notification when new messages arrive
in any folders they are tracking for new mail. This is not complete

To play sounds the plugin uses SoundManager 2 a free flash/javascript solution for
playing sounds inline in different browsers. The software is free and pretty lightweight:

The sounds I collected online, some of which I edited a bit to clean up. If any infringe
anybody's copyright please notify me at jason@hastymail.org and they will promptly be
removed.

To add sounds:

1 Put the sounds you want to add in the sounds directory of this plugin
2 Edit the sounds.php file and add them to the list. The list indexes are
  the names that show on the options page, the values are the mp3 filenames


Note: This plugins requires javascript, and to play sound files flash support

This is the initial version of the plugin so some bugs are expected.
Suggestions and feedback are welcome.
