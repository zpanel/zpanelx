This is a logging plugin for Hastymail2. It has support for 4 differnet
logging mechanisms and several options to control what events and
information is logged.

The 4 differnet log types are:

file   :   log to a specified file. The delimter between fields is configurable
syslog :   log to the system syslog with a specific log level
php    :   log to the log facility configured for PHP on this host
db     :   log to the db connection configured in the hastymail.conf file. A
           mysql create table statement is included in the table.sql file.

Event and information options include what fields to be logged and what
events should trigger a log message. See the included settings.php file
for more information.

Questions and feedback are always welcome.
