This plugin adds enhanced navigation for digest messages. Most mailing lists
support sending a single digest message daily instead of individual list messages.
When a digest message is detected a message list of the subject, from address, and
date are listed above the message body on the message view page. The subject is a
link to load that particular message part. To enable this plugin uncomment or add
the following to your hastymail2.conf file:

plugin = message_digest

Then rebuild your hastymail2.rc file and logout then back in to enable the plugin.
You will need to enable the digest display on the options page in the message view
section.
