This plugin allows sites to dynamically determine which IMAP server users should
login to based on an attribute in the user's LDAP entry.

The IMAP server and LDAP relationships are defined in the settings.php file 
(this file contains examples to illustrate the format). 

In order for this plugin to work each IMAP server used by this plugin MUST be 
defined in the hastymail.conf file using the alt_1, alt_2, etc style syntax.

To enable this plugin add or uncomment the following in your hastymail2.conf file

plugin = ldap_mailhost

Then rebuild your hastymail2.rc file, and logout of hastymail then back in for the
plugin to be enabled.
