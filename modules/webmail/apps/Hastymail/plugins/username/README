Username plugin
This is a simple plugin that adds the currently logged in username to the
top of the display next to the unread page link.

Enable the plugin by adding or uncommenting the following line in your
hastymail2.conf file:

plugin = username

Then rebuild your hastymail2.rc file, logout of hastymail2 and back in
and the plugin should be activated.
