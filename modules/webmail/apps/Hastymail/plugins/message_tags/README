This is the first beta version of the message tags plugin for Hastymail2.
This plugin lets users add free-form tags to messages.

The basics:
----------
- Messages can have multiple tags and be from any folder.
- To add or edit a message tag click on the tag icon in the message list or
  message view, edit the tag value, and hit the Enter key to save
- To cancel a tag addition or edit click anywhere else in the display before
  pressing Enter
- Tag values are limited to a-z upper or lower case, 0-9, underscore and dash
  (/^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]{2,}$/)
- Tagged messages can be viewed in a single list with the ability to filter
  the display combining tags with "and" and "or".
- Tagged message lists are accessed from the Tags link in the main menu or by
  enabling the tags summary display in the folder tree on the options page.
- When viewing a message in a tagged messge list their are prev/next/list links
  on the far right of the page below the header to navigate through the list
- Messages in tagged message lists can be acted on as a group with the standard
  message controls (move/copy/delete/etc)

Other stuff
-----------

- The plugin attempts to use the IMAP server to save tags as custom IMAP
  message flags. Not all IMAP servers support this ability (notably MS
  Exchange does not)
- The plugin maintains a map of the IMAP UID of a message to the tags assigned
  to that message. It is unlikely but possible that the message UIDs in a
  mailbox could change meaning the tag association would be lost.
- Message tags can be lost if a message is moved from one folder to another
  with a different mail client.
- If the IMAP server supports custom IMAP flags using the "Repair Tag Data"
  option on the main tags page will attempt to locate all the tagged messages
  and reconstruct the tag map
- If your IMAP sever does not support custom IMAP flags then this option will
  clean up any missing map references but will not be able to locate any
  lost tags


This plugin is a work in progress. Questions or comments can be
