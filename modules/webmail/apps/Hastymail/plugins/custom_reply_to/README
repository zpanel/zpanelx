This plugin adds a "reply-to" box on the compose page so the reply-to field of
outgoing messages can be altered on the fly. To enable this plugin add or uncomment
the following in your hastymail2.conf file

plugin = custom_reply_to

Then rebuild your hastymail2.rc file, and logout of hastymail then back in for the
plugin to be enabled. Once logged in the reply-to field can be enabled on a per user
basis in the compose section of the options page.

This plugin is a part of Hastymail so questions and comments can be directed to
our forums, mailing lists, or directly to me at jason@hastymail.org.
