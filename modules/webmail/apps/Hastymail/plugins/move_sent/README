This plugin adds the ability to select which folder to save sent mail to
on the compose page, and has a checkbox to move a replied-to message to
the same folder. To enable this plugin uncomment or add the following line
to your hastymail2.conf file:

plugin = move_sent

Rebuild your hastymail2.rc file and logout then back in to enable the plugin.
A setting will then be available in the compose section of the opitons page
called "Show Sent folder selection". This plugin is only compatible with
Hastymail2 versions RC8 or newer.

Thanks very much to Joerg S for writing the code and donating the plugin
to the Hastymail project
