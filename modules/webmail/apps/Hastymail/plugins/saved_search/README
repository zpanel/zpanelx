The saved_search plugin is a simple addtion to the search page that keeps track of
previous searches and allows you to save, edit, or rerun them with a single click.
To enable the plugin add or uncomment the following in your hastymail2.conf file:

plugin = saved_search

Don't forget to rebuild the hastymail2.rc file after editing the hastymail2.conf.
Plugin configs are cached when you login so be sure to logout and back in to
enable the plugin.
