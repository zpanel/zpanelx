This is a beta version of a pop3 fetch plugin for Hastymail2. This plugin lets
users setup information for pop3 email accounts and can fetch mail from those
accounts and deliver them to the specified local IMAP folder. To enable the plugin
add or uncomment the following in your hastymail2.conf file:

plugin = pop_fetch

Rebuild your hastymail2.rc file and logout then back in to enable the plugin.
Pop3 accounts and plugin options can be set using the "fetch" link in the main menu.
This is the first release of the plugin so testing and feedback is appreciated.
