The js_notice plugin is a simple plugin that uses javascript to show/hide notices and error
messages. To enable the plugin add or uncomment the following in your hastymail.conf file:

plugin = js_notice

Don't forget to rebuild the hastymail2.rc file after editing the hastymail2.conf.
Plugin configs are cached when you login so be sure to logout and back in to
enable the plugin This plugin is a part of Hastymail so questions and comments
can be directed to our forums, mailing lists, or directly to me at jason@hastymail.org.
