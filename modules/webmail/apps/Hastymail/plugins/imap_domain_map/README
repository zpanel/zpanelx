This plugin allows sites to dynamically determine which IMAP server users should
login to based on the domain portion of their login email address. The IMAP server
and domain relationships are defined in the settings.php file (this file contains
examples to illustrate the format). In order for this plugin to work each IMAP
server used by this plugin MUST be defined in the hastymail.conf file using the
alt_1, alt_2, etc style syntax.

To enable this plugin add or uncomment the following in your hastymail2.conf file

plugin = imap_domain_map

Then rebuild your hastymail2.rc file, and logout of hastymail then back in for the
plugin to be enabled.

This plugin is a part of Hastymail so questions and comments can be directed to
our forums, mailing lists, or directly to me at jason@hastymail.org.
