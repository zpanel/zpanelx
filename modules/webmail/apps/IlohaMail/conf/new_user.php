	PURPOSE:
        Do whatever needs to be done for a new user, that
        isn't done by the default program.  This might include
        something like sending them a welcoming email, or
        upgrading external databases.
        It can be anything as long as IT HAS NOT OUTPUT.
        
        This shouldn't require authentication or any sort of
        validation that could prevent the user from logging in.
        Any such processing must be done in conf/custom_auth.php
        
    PRE-CONDITION:
        $user_name - Login ID
        $password - Password
        $host - IMAP Server
        $error - Don't run if this isn't empty...
                    ...primary authentication failed.
    POST-CONDITION:
        Whatever that needs to be done...
