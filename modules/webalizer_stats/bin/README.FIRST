Upgrade information for the Webalizer Version 2.01

If you are using incremental mode, the data format for Version 2.01
is incompatable with previous versions, so you should remove your data
file (webalizer.current) and re-process from the beginning of the
month to recreate it.  If you do not use incremental mode, then
V2.00 should be a drop in replacement for 1.3x-xx, with the possible
exception of the two changed command line switches, -g and -F.  In
addition, there has been a number of new configuration keywords and
command line options added.  Please see the CHANGES file for additional
information regarding what has changed between versions.  You may also
want to take a look at the DNS.README file for information on the new
reverse DNS lookup capabilities.

***********
* NOTICE! *
*********** Version 1.30 and higher are INCOMPATABLE with any and
all previous versions of this program. File names have been changed,
and file formats have been modified.  If you are upgrading from
a previous version,  please read this ENTIRE DOCUMENT before you
proceed, as it contains important information that you will need.

Note: If you plan on re-processing all of your logs so they will
contain the new statistics, you can safely ignore the rest of
this document (although you really should read it anyway...).


QUICK UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS:

1) If you use incremental mode, read the section below, then
   delete your current incremental data file (webalizer.current).

2) Modify your history file (webalizer.hist) as described below.

3) Add any new configuration options that you want to your
   configuration file(s).  (See sample.conf for examples)

4) Rename existing files to use 4 digit year (see below).

5) Re-process your logs from beginning of the month (minimum).


INCREMENTAL PROCESSING CHANGE

The incremental file format has changed, therefore you MUST
REMOVE your current incremental file before running this
version.  Doing so will also force you to re-process all logs
from the beginning of the month, so if you have a large
site, you may want to wait until the end/beginning of the
month to perform the upgrade.


HISTORY FILE CHANGE

The history file format changed as well.  In order to use your
existing history file, you must manually edit it to add two
additional numbers to the end of each line.  These numbers
represent the total 'pages' and 'visits' for that particular
month.  You can do this using any standard text editor.

For example, if your existing history file looks like:

3 1999 56614 24758 234 180875 5 31
4 1999 156711 90240 1529 931048 1 30

You should change it to look like:

3 1999 56614 24758 234 180875 5 31 0 0
4 1999 156711 90240 1529 931048 1 30 0 0

Notice the extra two zeros ('0') at the end of each line.  There
will be _at most_ 12 lines for you to change.  You could of course
put some fake values (or real ones if you have them) and they
will show up on the main index page.  If you have access to a
unix command prompt and sed, you could also simply type:

cat webalizer.hist | sed "s/$/ 0 0/g" > webalizer.hist.tmp
mv webalizer.hist.tmp webalizer.hist

For those curious, the format of the history line is:
Month# Year# Hits Files Sites KBytes Fdom Ldom Pages Visits
(Fdom=First Ldom=Last day of month processed)

Note: It may be possible to leave your existing history file
in place, and the first run with the new version will convert
it to the new format.  It works on my linux system, it may
not work on yours...  It depends on how your particular platform
handles the missing data.  Probably better to not chance it ;)


CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES

Several new configuration and command line options have been
added.  The default values for these should be suitable for
most users,   however you might want to at least define the
PageType extensions for your particular system (default is to
use '.htm*' and '.cgi' extensions).  You should refer to the
CHANGES file to see what has been changed/added. See the files
README and sample.conf for additional details.


GENERATED FILE NAME CHANGES

Previous versions of the Webalizer created html and image files
using a format that included the month and year as two digit
strings (ie: 0399).  Even though the filenames themselves were
_only_ for humans, the Y2K scare has people freaked out over
such behaviour, and I'm tired of getting all the email about it :)
As a result, any existing files need to be renamed to include
the extra two digits.  The old format was MMYY, new format is
YYYYMM (and now they will sort correctly in directory listings :)
For example, change the file "usage_0599.html"to "usage_199905.html".
Image files for previous months do not need to be changed unless you
change the links in the previous month HTML pages as well.  The
current month files will be automatically generated with the correct
names.

Mike Glover submitted this little shell script that helps automate the
updating of files/filenames:

Upgrade Information for Webalizer V1.21 and higher

Some significant changes have occured between V1.20 and V1.21 of
the Webalizer.  Additional configuration keywords have been added
and incremental processing has been modified.  Due to these changes,
the following must be observed:

Old incremental data files are no longer compatable with the new
version.  Remove any existing incremental data files before running
the new version.  This version also adds the ability to define the
name and location of the incremental data file.  It will default to
the normal name and location (webalizer.current in the specified
output directory), however can be changed to an alternate location.
See "IncrementalName" and "HistoryName" configuration directives.
Note: you may check existing data files by looking at the first
line of the file... if it doesn't start with "# Webalizer ", then
it is an old style file and needs to be removed.

The configuration file has changed, however the only significant
difference is the definition of the HTMLHead keyword, which has
been changed in this version.  If you were using the HTMLHead
keyword in previous versions, change it to "HTMLBody", in order
to have it work as expected (as in previous versions).  See the
README file for additional information.
