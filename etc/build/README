This folder contains scripts and configuration files to make installation of ZPanel easier. This folder primarily exists to ensure that our enviroment configuration (build) scripts and application configuration scripts remain under source control.

The scripts provided in the root of this folder are designed to be run to setup your folder structure, setup any initial file permissions and also to copy the required configuration scripts to their correct installation directories.

Once you have ZPanel installed on your server you can delete this folder and contents if you'd like.
