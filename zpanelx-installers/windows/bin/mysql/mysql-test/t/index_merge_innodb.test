# depends on a pseudo random number generator (it picks up random
# pages to sample). After an optimization that was made in r2625 two
# EXPLAINs started returning a different number of rows (3 instead of
# 4)", so:
let $index_merge_random_rows_in_EXPLAIN = 1;
# InnoDB does not support Merge tables (affects include/index_merge1.inc)
