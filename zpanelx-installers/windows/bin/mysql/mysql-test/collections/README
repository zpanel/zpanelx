This directory contains collections of test runs that we run during our
integration and release testing. Each file contains zero or more lines,
with one invocation of mysql-test-run.pl on each. These invocations are
written so that, with the assumption that perl is in your search path,
any collection can run as a shell script or a batch file, with the parent
mysql-test directory being the current working directory.

During integration testing, we choose the collection to run by following
these steps:

1) We choose the extension to look for, based on these rules:
   - If we're running a per-push test, we choose ".push" as the extension.
   - If we're running a daily test, we choose ".daily" as the extension.
   - If we're running a weekly test, we choose ".weekly" as the extension.

2) If there is a collection that has the same name as the branch we're
   testing plus the extension as determined in step 1, we choose that
   collection.

3) If the branch is unknown or we have removed all characters from it
   and still not found a matching collection, we choose the name "default"
   plus the extension determined in step 1. If there is no such file,
   we give up and don't test anything at all.

4) If we haven't found a collection yet, we remove the last character from 
   the branch name and go back to step 2.

5) The commands from the collection are run line by line via execv() or
   similar system calls. They are not run as a shell script. Shell 
   expansions are not guaranteed to work and most likely won't.

The directory may contain collections that are "super sets" of others,
identified by a file name suffix ".in". These files may contain lines
"#include <filename>", or lines with mysql-test-run.pl invocations.
CMake will create a new file without the .in suffix where
the include lines are replaced with the contents of the referred
file. Filename is local to the collections directory, and includes do
not nest.
