  *) mod_cache: When content is served stale, and there is no means to
     revalidate the content using ETag or Last-Modified, and we have
     mandated no stale-on-error behaviour, stand down and don't cache.

  *) mod_ldap: Make LDAPSharedCacheSize 0 create a non-shared-memory cache per
     process as opposed to disabling caching completely. This allows to use
     the non-shared-memory cache as a workaround for the shared memory cache
     not being available during graceful restarts. PR 48958. [Stefan Fritsch]

     restart, such that processes of the previous generation were not
     observable.  [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.3.11

  *) core: Apply <If> sections to all requests, not only to file base requests.
     Allow to use <If> inside <Directory>, <Location>, and <Files> sections.

     sections, even if an <If> section is embedded inside a <Directory> or
     <Files> section.  [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy: Refactor usage of shared data by dropping the scoreboard
     and using slotmem. Create foundation for dynamic growth/changes of

     AP_MPMQ_MAX_THREADS.

  *) mod_authz_core: Fix bug in merging logic if user-based and non-user-based
     authorization directives were mixed. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_authn_socache: change directive name from AuthnCacheProvider
     to AuthnCacheProvideFor.  The term "provider" is overloaded in
     this module, and we should avoid confusion between the provider
     of a backend (AuthnCacheSOCache) and the authn provider(s) for
     which this module provides cacheing (AuthnCacheProvideFor).
     [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Allocate the fake backend request from a child pool
     of the backend connection, instead of misusing the pool of the frontend
     request. Fixes a thread safety issue where buckets set aside in the
     backend connection leak into other threads, and then disappear when
     the frontend request is cleaned up, in turn causing corrupted buckets
     to make other threads spin. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ssl: Change the format of the SSL_{CLIENT,SERVER}_{I,S}_DN variables
     to be RFC 2253 compatible, convert non-ASCII characters to UTF8, and
     escape other special characters with backslashes. The old format can
     still be used with the LegacyDNStringFormat argument to SSLOptions.

  *) core, mod_rewrite: Make the REQUEST_SCHEME variable available to
     scripts and mod_rewrite. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_rewrite: Allow to use arbitrary boolean expressions (ap_expr) in

  *) core: When selecting an IP-based virtual host, favor an exact match for
     the port over a wildcard (or omitted) port instead of favoring the one
     that came first in the configuration file. [Eric Covener]

  *) core: Overlapping virtual host address/port combinations  now implicitly
     enable name-based virtual hosting for that address.  The NameVirtualHost
     directive has no effect, and _default_ is interpreted the same as "*".
     [Eric Covener]

  *) core: In the absence of any Options directives, the default is now
     "FollowSymlinks" instead of "All".  [Igor GaliÄ‡]

  *) mod_headers: Change default first argument of Header directive
     from "onsuccess" to "always". [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_include: Add the onerror attribute to the include element,
     allowing an URL to be specified to include on error. [Graham
     Leggett]

  *) mod_cache_disk: mod_disk_cache renamed to mod_cache_disk, to be
     consistent with the naming of other modules. [Graham Leggett]

     expression. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy: Fix ProxyPassInterpolateEnv directive. PR 50292.
     [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) suEXEC: Add Suexec directive to disable suEXEC without renaming the
     binary (Suexec Off), or force startup failure if suEXEC is required
     but not supported (Suexec On).  Change SuexecUserGroup to fail
     startup instead of just printing a warning if suEXEC is disabled.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) core: Add Error directive for aborting startup or htaccess processing
     with a specified error message.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_rewrite: Fix the RewriteEngine directive to work within a
     location. Previously, once RewriteEngine was switched on globally,
     it was impossible to switch off. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core, mod_include, mod_ssl: Move the expression parser derived from
     mod_include back into mod_include. Replace ap_expr with a parser
     derived from mod_ssl's parser. Make mod_ssl use the new parser. Rework
     ap_expr's public interface and provide hooks for modules to add variables
     and functions. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Do the hook sorting earlier so that the hooks are properly sorted
     for the pre_config hook and during parsing the config. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: In the absence of any AllowOverride directives, the default is now
     "None" instead of "All".  PR49823 [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy: Don't allow ProxyPass or ProxyPassReverse in

     a put request (RFC 2616 14.16). PR 49825. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy: Release the backend connection as soon as EOS is detected,
     so the backend isn't forced to wait for the client to eventually
     acknowledge the data. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy: Optimise ProxyPass within a Location so that it is stored
     per-directory, and chosen during the location walk. Make ProxyPass
     work correctly from within a LocationMatch. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Fix segfault if per-module LogLevel is on virtual host
     scope. PR 50117. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy: Move the ProxyErrorOverride directive to have per

  *) mod_allowmethods: New module to deny certain HTTP methods without
     interfering with authentication/authorization. [Paul Querna,
     Igor GaliÄ‡, Stefan Fritsch]

     cert verification fails. PR 50093, PR 50094. [Lassi Tuura <lat cern ch>,
     Stefan Fritsch]

  *) htcacheclean: Teach htcacheclean to limit cache size by number of
     inodes in addition to size of files. Prevents a cache disk from
     running out of space when many small files are cached.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Rename MaxRequestsPerChild to MaxConnectionsPerChild, which
     describes more accurately what the directive does. The old name
     still works but logs a warning. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_cache: Optionally serve stale data when a revalidation returns a
     5xx response, controlled by the CacheStaleOnError directive.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) htcacheclean: Allow the listing of valid URLs within the cache, with
     the option to list entry metadata such as sizes and times. [Graham
     Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: correctly parse quoted strings in cache headers.
     PR 50199 [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_cache: Allow control over the base URL of reverse proxied requests
     using the CacheKeyBaseURL directive, so that the cache key can be
     calculated from the endpoint URL instead of the server URL. [Graham
     Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: CacheLastModifiedFactor, CacheStoreNoStore, CacheStorePrivate,
     CacheStoreExpired, CacheIgnoreNoLastMod, CacheDefaultExpire,
     CacheMinExpire and CacheMaxExpire can be set per directory/location.

  *) htcacheclean: Allow the option to round up file sizes to a given
     block size, improving the accuracy of disk usage. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ssl: Add authz providers for use with mod_authz_core and its
     RequireAny/RequireAll containers: 'ssl' (equivalent to SSLRequireSSL),
     'ssl-verify-client' (for use with 'SSLVerifyClient optional'), and
     'ssl-require' (expressions with same syntax as SSLRequire).
     [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_ssl: Make the ssl expression parser thread-safe. It now requires
     bison instead of yacc. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_disk_cache: Change on-disk header file format to support the
     link of the device/inode of the data file to the matching header
     file, and to support the option of not writing a data file when
     the data file is empty. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core/mod_unique_id: Add generate_log_id hook to allow to use
     the ID generated by mod_unique_id as error log ID for requests.
     [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_cache: Make sure that we never allow a 304 Not Modified response
     that we asked for to leak to the client should the 304 response be
     uncacheable. PR45341 [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Add the cache_status hook to register the final cache
     decision hit/miss/revalidate. Add optional support for an X-Cache
     and/or an X-Cache-Detail header to add the cache status to the
     response. PR48241 [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_authz_host: Add 'local' provider that matches connections originating
     on the local host. PR 19938. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) Event MPM: Fix crash accessing pollset on worker thread when child
     process is exiting.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) core: For process invocation (cgi, fcgid, piped loggers and so forth)
     pass the system library path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH or platform-specific
     variables) along with the system PATH, by default.  Both should be
     overridden together as desired using PassEnv etc; see mod_env.
     [William Rowe]

  *) mod_cache: Introduce CacheStoreExpired, to allow administrators to
     capture a stale backend response, perform If-Modified-Since requests
     against the backend, and serving from the cache all 304 responses.
     This restores pre-2.2.4 cache behavior.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_rewrite: Introduce <=, >= string comparison operators, and integer
     comparators -lt, -le, -eq, -ge, and -gt.  To help bash users and drop
     the ambiguity of the symlink test "-ltest", introduce -h or -L as
     symlink test operators.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_cache: Give the cache provider the opportunity to choose to cache
     or not cache based on the buckets present in the brigade, such as the
     presence of a FILE bucket.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_authz_core: Allow authz providers to check args while reading the
     config and allow to cache parsed args. Move 'all' and 'env' authz
     providers from mod_authz_host to mod_authz_core. Add 'method' authz
     provider depending on the HTTP method.  [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_include: Move the request_rec within mod_include to be
     exposed within include_ctx_t. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_include: Reinstate support for UTF-8 character sets by allowing a
     variable being echoed or set to be decoded and then encoded as separate
     steps. PR47686 [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Add a discrete commit_entity() provider function within the
     mod_cache provider interface which is called to indicate to the
     provider that caching is complete, giving the provider the opportunity
     to commit temporary files permanently to the cache in an atomic
     fashion. Replace the inconsistent use of error cleanups with a formal
     set of pool cleanups attached to a subpool, which is destroyed on error.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Change the signature of the store_body() provider function
     within the mod_cache provider interface to support an "in" brigade
     and an "out" brigade instead of just a single input brigade. This
     gives a cache provider the option to consume only part of the brigade
     passed to it, rather than the whole brigade as was required before.
     This fixes an out of memory and a request timeout condition that would
     occur when the original document was a large file. Introduce
     CacheReadSize and CacheReadTime directives to mod_disk_cache to control
     the amount of data to attempt to cache at a time. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Add ErrorLogFormat to allow configuring error log format, including
     additional information that is logged once per connection or request. Add
     error log IDs for connections and request to allow correlating error log
     lines and the corresponding access log entry. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Disable sendfile by default. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_cache: Check the request to determine whether we are allowed
     to return cached content at all, and respect a "Cache-Control:
     no-cache" header from a client. Previously, "no-cache" would
     behave like "max-age=0". [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Use a proper filter context to hold filter data instead
     of misusing the per-request configuration. Fixes a segfault on trunk
     when the normal handler is used. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cgid: Log a warning if the ScriptSock path is truncated because
     it is too long. PR 49388.  [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) vhosts: Do not allow _default_ in NameVirtualHost, or mixing *
     and non-* ports on NameVirtualHost, or multiple NameVirtualHost
     directives for the same address:port, or NameVirtualHost
     directives with no matching VirtualHosts, or multiple ip-based
     VirtualHost sections for the same address:port.  These were
     previously accepted with a warning, but the behavior was
     undefined.  [Dan Poirier]

     parameters to the environment. Improve portability to
     EBCDIC machines by using apr_toupper(). [Martin Kraemer]

  *) mod_ldap, mod_authnz_ldap: Add support for nested groups (i.e. the ability
     to authorize an authenticated user via a "require ldap-group X" directive
     where the user is not in group X, but is in a subgroup contained in X.
     PR 42891 [Paul J. Reder]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for caching SSL Sessions in memcached. [Paul Querna]

  *) apxs: Enhance -q flag to print all known variables and their values
     when invoked without variable name(s).
     [William Rowe, Sander Temme]

  *) apxs: Eliminate run-time check for mod_so.  PR 40653.
     [David M. Lee <dmlee crossroads.com>]

  *) beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) netware MPM: Destroy pmain pool when exiting ap_mpm_run() so that
     cleanups registered in modules' child_init hooks are performed.
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) Fix issue which could cause error messages to be written to access logs
     on Win32.  PR 40476.  [Tom Donovan <Tom.Donovan acm.org>]

  *) The LockFile directive, which specifies the location of
     the accept() mutex lockfile, is deprecated. Instead, the
     AcceptMutex directive now takes an optional lockfile
     location parameter, ala SSLMutex. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_dbd: Key the storage of prepared statements on the hex string
     value of server_rec, rather than the server name, as the server name
     may change (eg when the server name is set) at any time, causing
     weird behaviour in modules dependent on mod_dbd. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: Added win32 build. [Mladen Turk]

  *) sendfile_nonblocking() takes the _brigade_ as an argument, gets
     the first bucket from the brigade, finds it not to be a FILE
     bucket and barfs. The fix is to pass a bucket rather than a brigade.
     [Niklas Edmundsson <nikke acc.umu.se>]

  *) mod_rewrite: support rewritemap by SQL query [Nick Kew]

  *) ap_get_server_version() has been removed.  Third-party modules must
     now use ap_get_server_banner() or ap_get_server_description().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) All MPMs: Introduce a check_config phase between pre_config and
     open_logs, to allow modules to review interdependent configuration
     directive values and adjust them while messages can still be logged
     to the console.  Handle relevant MPM directives during this phase
     and format messages for both the console and the error log, as
     appropriate.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) core: Do not allow internal redirects like the DirectoryIndex of mod_dir
     to circumvent the symbolic link checks imposed by FollowSymLinks and
     SymLinksIfOwnerMatch. [Nick Kew, Ruediger Pluem, William Rowe]

  *) New SSLLogLevelDebugDump [ None (default) | IO (not bytes) | Bytes ]
     configures the I/O Dump of SSL traffic, when LogLevel is set to Debug.
     The default is none as this is far greater debugging resolution than
     the typical administrator is prepared to untangle.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_disk_cache: If possible, check if the size of an object to cache is
     within the configured boundaries before actually saving data.
     [Niklas Edmundsson <nikke acc.umu.se>]

  *) Worker and event MPMs: Remove improper scoreboard updates which were
     performed in the event of a fork() failure.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Add support for fcgi:// proxies to mod_rewrite.
     [Markus Schiegl <ms schiegl.com>]

  *) Remove incorrect comments from scoreboard.h regarding conditional
     loading of worker_score structure with mod_status, and remove unused
     definitions relating to old life_status field.
     [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) Remove allocation of memory for unused array of lb_score pointers
     in ap_init_scoreboard().  [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) Add mod_proxy_fcgi, a FastCGI back end for mod_proxy.
     [Garrett Rooney, Jim Jagielski, Paul Querna]

  *) Event MPM: Fill in the scoreboard's tid field. PR 38736.
     [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) mod_charset_lite: Remove Content-Length when output filter can
     invalidate it.  Warn when input filter can invalidate it.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authn_core that will provide common
     authn directives such as 'AuthType', 'AuthName'.  Move the directives
     'AuthType' and 'AuthName' out of the core module and merge mod_authz_alias
     into mod_authn_core. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the directives 'Order', 'Allow', 'Deny' and 'Satisfy'
     into the new module mod_access_compat which can be loaded to provide
     support for these directives.
     [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the 'Require' directive from the core module as well as
     add the directives '<SatisfyAll>', '<SatisfyOne>', '<RequireAlias>'
     and 'Reject' to mod_authz_core. The new directives introduce 'AND/OR'
     logic into the authorization processing. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authz_core which acts as the
     authorization provider vector and contains common authz
     directives. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Renamed mod_authz_dbm authz providers from 'group' and
     'file-group' to 'dbm-group' and 'dbm-file-group'. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Added the new authz providers 'env', 'ip', 'host', 'all' to handle
     host-based access control provided by mod_authz_host and invoked
     through the 'Require' directive. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Convert all of the authz modules from hook based to
     provider based. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) mod_cache: Add CacheMinExpire directive to set the minimum time in
     seconds to cache a document.
     [Brian Akins <brian.akins turner.com>, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_authz_dbd: SQL authz with Login/Session support [Nick Kew]

  *) Fix typo in ProxyStatus syntax error message.
     [Christophe Jaillet <christophe.jaillet wanadoo.fr>]

  *) Asynchronous write completion for the Event MPM.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added an End-Of-Request bucket type.  The logging of a request and
     the freeing of its pool are now done when the EOR bucket is destroyed.
     This has the effect of delaying the logging until right after the last
     of the response is sent; ap_core_output_filter() calls the access logger
     indirectly when it destroys the EOR bucket.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Rewrite of logresolve support utility: IPv6 addresses are now supported
     and the format of statistical output has changed. [Colm MacCarthaigh]

  *) Rewrite of ap_coreoutput_filter to do nonblocking writes  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added new connection states for handler and write completion
     [Brian Pane]

  *) mod_cgid: Refuse to work on Solaris 10 due to OS bugs.  PR 34264.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Teach mod_ssl to use arbitrary OIDs in an SSLRequire directive,
     allowing string-valued client certificate attributes to be used for
     access control, as in: SSLRequire "value" in OID("1.3.6.1.4.1.18060.1")
