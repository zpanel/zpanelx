<H2><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</A></H2><PRE>
     <B>Cdcc</B> is used to clear, control, and query the control file used by Dis-
     tributed Checksum Clearinghouse clients such as <B><A HREF="dccm.html">dccm(8)</A></B>.  The host names,
     UDP port numbers, IDs, and passwords local clients use to talk to servers
     as well as IP addresses, round trip times, and other information are con-
     tained in the <I>map</I> file.  While <B>cdcc</B> is set-UID, it uses the real UID only
     when accessing the <I>map</I> file.  It refuses to display sensitive information
     such as passwords unless the real UID is the same as the effective UID.
     Note that <B>cdcc</B> needs to be set to a UID that can read and write the <I>map</I>
     file, but that UID need not be 0.

     <B>Cdcc</B> is also used to send commands to DCC servers to tell them to stop,
     reload their lists of DCC IDs, turn on tracing, and so forth.

     Many commands sent to DCC servers require a numeric DCC ID and a password
     recognized by the server.  A DCC password is a 1-32 character string that
     does not contain blank, tab, newline or carriage return characters.  The
     ID is specified with the <B>id</B> operation.  If <B>cdcc</B> is run with a real UID
     that can read the <I>ids</I> file and a password is not specified (see the
     <B>password</B> operation), then the current password for the specified ID in
     the <I>ids</I> file will be used.  If no <I>ids</I> file is available and a password
     and DCC ID are not specified, <B>cdcc</B> uses the anonymous DCC client-ID.  DCC
     servers do not expect a password from clients using the anonymous client-
     ID, but they also won't honor control requests.

     Operations that modify the <I>map</I> file can only be performed when the real
     UID is sufficient to modify the file directly.  Trying to perform an
     operation that requires a password without specifying a server-ID or
     without using a UID that can access the <I>ids</I> file produces an error mes-
     sage complaining about a "privileged operation."

     Commands and operations are read from the command line or from stdin.  A
     series of <I>op1</I> <I>op2</I> <I>...</I> operations followed a <I>-</I> (a dash) causes operations
     to be read from stdin after the command line operations are processed.
     Semi-colons or newlines separate commands in UNIX command-line "words,"
     as well as when commands are read from stdin.  Since each command line
     operation must be a shell "word," quotes are often required as in

           % cdcc "load map.txt"
     or

           % cdcc "host localhost;info" stats

   <A NAME="OPTIONS"><B>OPTIONS</B></A>
     The following options are available:

     <A NAME="OPTION-V"><B>-V</B></A>   displays the version of the DCC controller.

     <A NAME="OPTION-d"><B>-d</B></A>   enables debugging output from the DCC client library.  Additional <B>-d</B>
          options increase the number of messages.  <B>-q</B> quiets initial com-
          plaints about the map file, and some messages about successful com-
          mands.

     <A NAME="OPTION-h"><B>-h</B></A> <I>homedir</I>
          overrides the default DCC home directory, which is often /var/dcc.
          See the <B>homedir</B> operation.

     <A NAME="OPTION-c"><B>-c</B></A> <I>ids</I>
          specifies file containing DCC IDs and passwords known by the local
          DCC server.  An <I>ids</I> file that can be read by others cannot be used.
          The format of the <I>ids</I> file is described in <B><A HREF="dccd.html">dccd(8)</A></B>.

     <I>op1</I> <I>op2</I> <I>...</I>
          are operations or commands such as "id 100; stop".  Commands or
          operations specified on the command line are performed before the
          first interactive request.  The last command can be <I>-</I> to specify
          that additional commands should be read from stdin.

   <A NAME="OPERATIONS"><B>OPERATIONS</B></A>
     Local operations include the following:

     <A NAME="OPERATION-help"><B>help</B></A> [<I>command</I>]
           lists information about one or all available commands and opera-
           tions.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-exit"><B>exit</B></A>  stops <B>cdcc</B>

     <A NAME="OPERATION-grey"><B>grey</B></A> [<I>on</I> | <I>off</I>]
           switches between DCC and greylist servers.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-homedir"><B>homedir</B></A> [<I>path</I>]
           displays or specifies the DCC home directory.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-file"><B>file</B></A> [<I>map</I>]
           displays or specifies the name or path of the map file.  The string
           "-" specifies the default file <I>map</I> in the DCC home directory.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-new-map"><B>new map</B></A> [<I>map</I>]
           creates a new, empty file for DCC server host names, port numbers,
           passwords, and so forth.  There must not already be a file of the
           same name.  The default is <I>map</I> in the DCC home directory.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-delete"><B>delete</B></A> <I>host</I>[,<I>port</I>]
           deletes the entry in the <I>map</I> file for <I>host</I> and UDP <I>port.</I> If
           greylist mode has been set with the <B>grey on</B> command, the entry for
           the grelist server at <I>host</I> is deleted.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-add"><B>add</B></A> <I>host</I>[,<I>port</I>] [<I>RTT+adj</I>|<I>RTT-adj</I>] [<I>Greylist</I>] [<I>client-ID</I> [password]]
           adds an entry to the <I>map</I> file.  The <I>port</I> can be "-" to specify the
           default DCC server port number.

           An adjustment to the round trip time is a multiple of 10 millisec-
           onds between -4000 and +4000 following the string <I>RTT</I>.  The adjust-
           ment is added to the average measured round trip time when the DCC
           client software picks the "nearest" DCC server, or the server with
           the smallest RTT.  If an IP address is mentioned more than once in
           the list of servers, for example because it is among the addresses
           for more than one server name, conflicts among RTT adjustments are
           resolved by picking the adjustment with the largest absolute value.

           <I>Greylist</I> marks an entry for a greylist servers.  <I>Greylist</I> is
           assumed if greylist mode has been set with the <B>grey on</B> command, See
           <B><A HREF="dccd.html">dccd(8)</A></B>.

           If both the client-ID and the password are absent, the anonymous
           client-ID, 1, is used.  The string <I>anon</I> is equivalent to the anony-
           mous client-ID.  A null password string is assumed if the password
           is missing and the client-ID is 1 or also missing.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-load"><B>load</B></A> <I>info-file</I>
           loads the current parameter file with the host names, port numbers,
           IDs, and passwords in <I>info-file</I>.  Standard input is understood if
           <I>info-file</I> is "-".

           A suitable file can be created with the <B>info</B> operation.  It con-
           sists of ignored blank or comment lines starting with '#' and other
           lines in the same format as the arguments to the <B>add</B> operation.
           Note that output of the <B>info</B> command will lack passwords unless it
           is run by a privileged user.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-host"><B>host</B></A> [<I>hostname</I>]
           specifies the host name of the DCC server to which commands should
           be sent.  If <I>hostname</I> is "-", the current default DCC server is
           chosen.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-port"><B>port</B></A> [<I>port</I>]
           specifies the UDP port number of the DCC server to which commands
           should be sent.  The default is 6277 or 6276 depending on the set-
           ting of the greylist mode controlled with the <B>grey</B> command.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-password"><B>password</B></A> <I>secret</I>
           specifies the password with which to sign commands sent to the DCC
           server specified with the <B>server</B> and <B>port</B> operations.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-id"><B>id</B></A> [<I>ID</I>]
           specifies or displays the numeric DCC ID for commands sent to the
           DCC server specified with the <B>server</B> and <B>port</B> operations.  If no
           password is specified with the <B>password</B> command, the password is
           sought in the local <I>ids</I>.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-info"><B>info</B></A> [<B>-N</B>]
           displays information about the connections to DCC servers.  It
           starts with the current date and name of the current <I>map</I> file or
           says that <B>cdcc</B> is using the implicit file created with the <B>server</B>
           and <B>port</B> operations.  It then says when host names will next be
           resolved into IP addresses, the smallest round trip time to the IP
           addresses of known DCC servers.  The host name, UDP port number (or
           dash if it is the default), DCC client-ID, and password (if <B>cdcc</B> is
           used by a privileged user) are shown in one line per configured DCC
           server.

           The currently preferred IP address is indicated by an asterisk.
           The "brand" of the server, its DCC ID, and its IP address are dis-
           played in one line per IP address.  The performance of the server
           at each IP address in the most recent 32 operations is displayed in
           a second line.  The second line ends with the measured delay
           imposed by the server on requests with this client's ID.

           <B>-N</B> displays the reverse DNS name of each server.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-RTT"><B>RTT</B></A> [<B>-N</B>]
           measures the round trip time to the DCC servers.  It does this by
           discarding accumulated information and forcing a probe of all
           listed server IP addresses.

           <I>Beware</I> that when run with sufficient privilege, the <B>RTT</B> operation
           is like the <B>info</B> and <B>load</B> operations and displays cleartext pass-
           words.

           <B>-N</B> displays the reverse DNS name of each server.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-debug"><B>debug</B></A> [<I>on</I> | <I>off</I> | <I>TTL=x</I>]
           increases or decreases debugging information from the DCC client
           library or sets the IP TTL on queries to the server.  See <B>-d</B>.

           Some systems do not include the functions required to change the IP
           TTL.  Others apparently including Microsoft Windows XP include
           required functions but have no apparent effect.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-IPv6"><B>IPv6</B></A> [<I>on</I> | <I>off</I>]
           sets a switch to cause clients using the map file to try to use
           IPv6.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-SOCKS"><B>SOCKS</B></A> [<I>on</I> <I>off</I>]
           sets a switch to cause DCC clients using the map to use the SOCKS5
           protocol, if they have been built with a SOCKS library.  The socks
           library linked with the DCC client must be configured appropri-
           ately, often including knowing which DCC servers must be connected
           via the SOCKS proxy and which can be reached directly.  DCC clients
           use SOCKS functions such as Rsendto() with all or no servers
           depending on the setting of this switch.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-src"><B>src</B></A> [<I>-</I> | <I>IPaddress</I>]
           displays or configures the source address of DCC client requests.
           <I>-</I> removes the explicit configuration of the source, while <I>IPaddress</I>
           sets it.  This makes sense only on multi-homed hosts.  It can be
           useful for passing firewalls.

   <A NAME="DCC-SERVER-COMMANDS"><B>DCC SERVER COMMANDS</B></A>
     Commands that can be sent to a DCC server include the following.  Most of
     the commands must be used with the server's <I>ID</I> specified with the <B>id</B> com-
     mand.  The specified ID is included in the commands sent to the server
     The command itself is digitally signed with the first password associated
     with the ID in the <I>ids</I> file.  The server requires that the signature
     match one of the passwords associated with the ID in its <I>ids</I> file.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-delck-type-hex1-hex2-hex3-hex4"><B>delck type hex1 hex2 hex3 hex4</B></A>
          asks the server to delete the <I>type</I> checksum with value <I>hex1</I> <I>hex2</I>
          <I>hex3</I> <I>hex4</I>.  The type and checksum values can be found in <B><A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc(8)</A></B>
          and <B><A HREF="dccm.html">dccm(8)</A></B> log files or computed with <I>dccproc</I> <B>-QC</B>.

          There are very few situations where it makes sense to bother to
          delete checksums.  For example, mail that was accidentally reported
          with a target count of "MANY" is either private and so will not be
          seen by other people and so will not be affected, or it is bulk and
          its source so must have already been white-listed by recipients.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-stats"><B>stats</B></A> [<I>all</I> | <I>clear</I>]
          displays current status and statistics from the current DCC server
          or for <I>all</I> known DCC servers.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-clients"><B>clients</B></A> [<B>-nsiaV</B>] [<I>max</I> [<I>thold</I>]] [<I>addr</I>[<I>/prefix</I>]]
          displays some of the clients recently seen by the server.
          <B>clients -n</B> displays only the IP addresses and not the names of
          clients.  <B>clients -s</B> sorts the clients by the number of requests
          they have made.  <B>clients -i</B> counts clients with the same client-ID
          as single entities.  <B>clients -a</B> produces 24 hour average numbers of
          requests.  <B>clients</B> <I>max</I> displays only the <I>max</I> most recent clients.
          <B>clients</B> <I>max</I> <I>thold</I> displays the most recent <I>max</I> clients that have
          made at least <I>thold</I> requests.

          <B>clients -V</B> includes information about DCC protocol versions used by
          clients.

          If present, <I>addr</I>[<I>/prefix</I>] restricts the results to the DCC client
          with that IP address or clients with addresses in that CIDR block.

          The mechanism that implements this command involves asking the DCC
          server for the first approximately 100 clients, then the second
          about 100, and so on, If entries change position in the complete
          list maintained by the server between requests, the displayed list
          will have duplicate or missing entries.

          Only clients heard from since the server was started or <B>stats clear</B>
          was last used are displayed.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-stop"><B>stop</B></A>
          tells the DCC server to exit.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-system-stop"><B>system stop</B></A>
          tells the DCC server to exit so that the operating system can be
          shut down.  This tells the DCC server on some systems to delete the
          dcc_db.hash file to speed system shut down.  The file will be
          rebuilt automatically by <B>dbclean</B> when the DCC server is restarted.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-clean-stop"><B>clean stop</B></A>
          tells the DCC server to exit after applying fsync() to the database.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-reload-IDs"><B>reload IDs</B></A>
          tells the local DCC server to reload its DCC <I>ids</I> file immediately.
          This command is not strictly needed.  Every several minutes, the DCC
          server notices if the file has been changed and automatically reads
          it.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-flood-check"><B>flood check</B></A>
          tells the DCC server to check for changes in the <I>flod</I> file and try
          to restart any of the streams to peers that are broken.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-flood-shutdown"><B>flood shutdown</B></A>
          tells the DCC server to cleanly stop flooding checksums to and from
          peers.  The server will wait for sending and receiving peers to
          agree to stop.  Each <B>flood shutdown</B> or <B>flood halt</B> request increases
          a count of reasons why the server should not flood checksums.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-flood-halt"><B>flood halt</B></A>
          tells the DCC server to abruptly stop flooding checksums to and from
          peers.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-flood-rewind"><B>flood rewind</B></A> <I>server-ID</I>
          tells the DCC server to ask its peer with <I>server-ID</I> to rewind and
          resend its stream of checksums.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-flood-ffwd-in"><B>flood ffwd in</B></A> <I>server-ID</I>
          tells the DCC server to ask its peer to "fast forward" or skip to
          the end of the incoming flood.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-flood-ffwd-out"><B>flood ffwd out</B></A> <I>server-ID</I>
          tells the DCC server to "fast forward" or skip to the current end of
          the flood to its peer.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-flood-resume"><B>flood resume</B></A>
          tells the DCC server to reduce the number of reasons to not flood
          checksums increased by <B>flood shutdown</B> and <B>flood halt.</B> When the num-
          ber of reasons reaches zero, the server tries to resume flooding.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-flood-list"><B>flood list</B></A>
          displays the list of current incoming and outgoing floods.  Each
          line contains the server-ID of the peer, the IP address and port
          used for the outgoing flood, the address for the incoming flood if
          different, and the host name.  Only the server-IDs of flooding peers
          are disclosed with the server's ID.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-flood-stats"><B>flood stats</B></A> [<B>clear</B>] { <I>server-ID</I> | <I>all</I> }
          displays counts of checksum reports sent and received by the current
          flooding connections to and from <I>server-ID</I> or <I>all</I> flooding connec-
          tions and then optionally clears the counts.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-DB-unlock"><B>DB unlock</B></A>
          is used by <B>dbclean</B> to tell the server that the database expiration
          has begun.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-DB-new"><B>DB new</B></A>
          is used by <B>dbclean</B> to tell the server that the database cleaning is
          complete.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-trace"><B>trace</B></A> <I>mode</I> <I>{on|off}</I>
          turns the server's tracing <I>mode</I> on or off.  <I>Mode</I> must be one of:
            <I>ADMN</I>    administrative requests from <B>cdcc</B>
            <I>ANON</I>    errors by anonymous clients
            <I>CLNT</I>    errors by authenticated clients
            <I>RLIM</I>    rate-limited messages
            <I>QUERY</I>   all queries and reports
            <I>RIDC</I>    messages concerning the report-ID cache that is used to
                    detect duplicate reports from clients
            <I>FLOOD</I>   messages about inter-server flooding connections
            <I>FLOOD2</I>  messages about flooded reports
            <I>IDS</I>     unknown server-IDs in flooded reports
            <I>BL</I>      blacklisted clients

     <A NAME="OPERATION-trace"><B>trace</B></A> <I>default</I>
          turns on <I>ANON</I> and <I>CLNT</I> tracing and turns off all others.

     <A NAME="OPERATION-cdcc"><B>cdcc</B></A> exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs in operations speci-
     fied on the command line.
