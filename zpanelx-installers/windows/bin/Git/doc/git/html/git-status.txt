git-status(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-status - Show the working tree status


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-status' <options>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the
current HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working
tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not
tracked by git (and are not ignored by linkgit:gitignore[5]). The first
are what you _would_ commit by running `git commit`; the second and
third are what you _could_ commit by running `git add` before running
`git commit`.

The command takes the same set of options as `git-commit`; it
shows what would be committed if the same options are given to
`git-commit`.

If there is no path that is different between the index file and
the current HEAD commit (i.e., there is nothing to commit by running
`git-commit`), the command exits with non-zero status.


OUTPUT
------
The output from this command is designed to be used as a commit
template comment, and all the output lines are prefixed with '#'.

The paths mentioned in the output, unlike many other git commands, are
made relative to the current directory if you are working in a
subdirectory (this is on purpose, to help cutting and pasting). See
the status.relativePaths config option below.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The command honors `color.status` (or `status.color` -- they
mean the same thing and the latter is kept for backward
compatibility) and `color.status.<slot>` configuration variables
to colorize its output.

If the config variable `status.relativePaths` is set to false, then all
paths shown are relative to the repository root, not to the current
directory.

If `status.submodulesummary` is set to a non zero number or true (identical
to -1 or an unlimited number), the submodule summary will be enabled and a
summary of commits for modified submodules will be shown (see --summary-limit
option of linkgit:git-submodule[1]).
