NAME
----
git-mv - Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-mv' <options>... <args>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This script is used to move or rename a file, directory or symlink.

 git-mv [-f] [-n] <source> <destination>
 git-mv [-f] [-n] [-k] <source> ... <destination directory>

In the first form, it renames <source>, which must exist and be either
a file, symlink or directory, to <destination>.
In the second form, the last argument has to be an existing
directory; the given sources will be moved into this directory.

The index is updated after successful completion, but the change must still be
committed.

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
	Force renaming or moving of a file even if the target exists
-k::
        Skip move or rename actions which would lead to an error
	condition. An error happens when a source is neither existing nor
        controlled by GIT, or when it would overwrite an existing
        file unless '-f' is given.
-n::
--dry-run::
	Do nothing; only show what would happen
