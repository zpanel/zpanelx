==================

NAME
----
git-upload-pack - Send objects packed back to git-fetch-pack


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-upload-pack' [--strict] [--timeout=<n>] <directory>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Invoked by 'git-fetch-pack', learns what
objects the other side is missing, and sends them after packing.

This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user.
The UI for the protocol is on the 'git-fetch-pack' side, and the
program pair is meant to be used to pull updates from a remote
repository.  For push operations, see 'git-send-pack'.


OPTIONS

--strict::
	Do not try <directory>/.git/ if <directory> is no git directory.

--timeout=<n>::
	Interrupt transfer after <n> seconds of inactivity.

<directory>::
	The repository to sync from.
