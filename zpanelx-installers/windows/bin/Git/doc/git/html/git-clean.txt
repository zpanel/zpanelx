git-clean(1)
============

NAME
----
git-clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git-clean' [-d] [-f] [-n] [-q] [-x | -X] [--] <paths>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Removes files unknown to git.  This allows to clean the working tree
from files that are not under version control.  If the '-x' option is
specified, ignored files are also removed, allowing to remove all
build products.
When optional `<paths>...` arguments are given, the paths
affected are further limited to those that match them.


OPTIONS
-------
-d::
	Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files.

-f::
	If the git configuration specifies clean.requireForce as true,
	git-clean will refuse to run unless given -f or -n.

-n::
--dry-run::
	Don't actually remove anything, just show what would be done.

-q::
--quiet::
	Be quiet, only report errors, but not the files that are
	successfully removed.

-x::
	Don't use the ignore rules.  This allows removing all untracked
	files, including build products.  This can be used (possibly in
	conjunction with linkgit:git-reset[1]) to create a pristine
	working directory to test a clean build.

-X::
	Remove only files ignored by git.  This may be useful to rebuild
	everything from scratch, but keep manually created files.
