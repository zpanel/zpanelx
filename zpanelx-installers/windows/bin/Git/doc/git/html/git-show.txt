git-show(1)
===========

NAME
----
git-show - Show various types of objects


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-show' [options] <object>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).

For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also
presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by
'git-diff-tree --cc'.

For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.

For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to linkgit:git-ls-tree[1]
with \--name-only).

For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.

The command takes options applicable to the linkgit:git-diff-tree[1] command to
control how the changes the commit introduces are shown.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.


OPTIONS
-------
<object>::
	The name of the object to show.
	For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see
	"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in linkgit:git-rev-parse[1].
