git-get-tar-commit-id(1)
========================

NAME
----
git-get-tar-commit-id - Extract commit ID from an archive created using git-archive


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-get-tar-commit-id' < <tarfile>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Acts as a filter, extracting the commit ID stored in archives created by
linkgit:git-archive[1].  It reads only the first 1024 bytes of input, thus its
runtime is not influenced by the size of <tarfile> very much.

If no commit ID is found, git-get-tar-commit-id quietly exists with a
return code of 1.  This can happen if <tarfile> had not been created
using git-archive or if the first parameter of git-archive had been
a tree ID instead of a commit ID or tag.
