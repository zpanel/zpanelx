read this manual.</p><p>The best way to get one is by using the <a href="git-clone.html" target="_top">git-clone(1)</a> command to
download a copy of an existing repository.  If you don't already have a
project in mind, here are some interesting examples:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>        # git itself (approx. 10MB download):<br>
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git<br>
        # the linux kernel (approx. 150MB download):<br>
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git</p></div><p>The initial clone may be time-consuming for a large project, but you
will only need to clone once.</p><p>The clone command creates a new directory named after the project ("git"
or "linux-2.6" in the examples above).  After you cd into this
directory, you will see that it contains a copy of the project files,
called the <a href="#def_working_tree">working tree</a>, together with a special
top-level directory named ".git", which contains all the information
about the history of the project.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="how-to-check-out"></a>How to check out a different version of a project</h2></div></div></div><p>Git is best thought of as a tool for storing the history of a collection
of files.  It stores the history as a compressed collection of
interrelated snapshots of the project's contents.  In git each such
version is called a <a href="#def_commit">commit</a>.</p><p>Those snapshots aren't necessarily all arranged in a single line from
oldest to newest; instead, work may simultaneously proceed along
parallel lines of development, called <a href="#def_branch">branches</a>, which may
merge and diverge.</p><p>A single git repository can track development on multiple branches.  It
does this by keeping a list of <a href="#def_head">heads</a> which reference the
latest commit on each branch; the <a href="git-branch.html" target="_top">git-branch(1)</a> command shows
you the list of branch heads:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch<br>
* master</p></div><p>A freshly cloned repository contains a single branch head, by default
named "master", with the working directory initialized to the state of
the project referred to by that branch head.</p><p>Most projects also use <a href="#def_tag">tags</a>.  Tags, like heads, are
references into the project's history, and can be listed using the
<a href="git-tag.html" target="_top">git-tag(1)</a> command:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git tag -l<br>
v2.6.11<br>
v2.6.11-tree<br>
v2.6.12<br>
v2.6.12-rc2<br>
v2.6.12-rc3<br>
v2.6.12-rc4<br>
v2.6.12-rc5<br>
v2.6.12-rc6<br>
v2.6.13<br>
...</p></div><p>Tags are expected to always point at the same version of a project,
while heads are expected to advance as development progresses.</p><p>Create a new branch head pointing to one of these versions and check it
out using <a href="git-checkout.html" target="_top">git-checkout(1)</a>:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout -b new v2.6.13</p></div><p>The working directory then reflects the contents that the project had
when it was tagged v2.6.13, and <a href="git-branch.html" target="_top">git-branch(1)</a> shows two
branches, with an asterisk marking the currently checked-out branch:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch<br>
  master<br>
* new</p></div><p>If you decide that you'd rather see version 2.6.17, you can modify
the current branch to point at v2.6.17 instead, with</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git reset --hard v2.6.17</p></div><p>Note that if the current branch head was your only reference to a
particular point in history, then resetting that branch may leave you
with no way to find the history it used to point to; so use this command
carefully.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="understanding-commits"></a>Understanding History: Commits</h2></div></div></div><p>Every change in the history of a project is represented by a commit.

did, and why.</p><p>Every commit has a 40-hexdigit id, sometimes called the "object name" or the
"SHA1 id", shown on the first line of the "git show" output.  You can usually
refer to a commit by a shorter name, such as a tag or a branch name, but this
longer name can also be useful.  Most importantly, it is a globally unique
name for this commit: so if you tell somebody else the object name (for
example in email), then you are guaranteed that name will refer to the same
commit in their repository that it does in yours (assuming their repository
has that commit at all).  Since the object name is computed as a hash over the
contents of the commit, you are guaranteed that the commit can never change
without its name also changing.</p><p>In fact, in <a href="#git-concepts" title="Chapter 7. Git concepts">Chapter 7, <i>Git concepts</i></a> we shall see that everything stored in git
history, including file data and directory contents, is stored in an object
with a name that is a hash of its contents.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="understanding-reachability"></a>Understanding history: commits, parents, and reachability</h3></div></div></div><p>Every commit (except the very first commit in a project) also has a
parent commit which shows what happened before this commit.
Following the chain of parents will eventually take you back to the
beginning of the project.</p><p>However, the commits do not form a simple list; git allows lines of
development to diverge and then reconverge, and the point where two
lines of development reconverge is called a "merge".  The commit
representing a merge can therefore have more than one parent, with
each parent representing the most recent commit on one of the lines
of development leading to that point.</p><p>The best way to see how this works is using the <a href="gitk.html" target="_top">gitk(1)</a>
command; running gitk now on a git repository and looking for merge
commits will help understand how the git organizes history.</p><p>In the following, we say that commit X is "reachable" from commit Y
if commit X is an ancestor of commit Y.  Equivalently, you could say
that Y is a descendant of X, or that there is a chain of parents
leading from commit Y to commit X.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="history-diagrams"></a>Understanding history: History diagrams</h3></div></div></div><p>We will sometimes represent git history using diagrams like the one
below.  Commits are shown as "o", and the links between them with
lines drawn with - / and \.  Time goes left to right:</p><pre class="literallayout">         o--o--o &lt;-- Branch A
        /
 o--o--o &lt;-- master
        \
         o--o--o &lt;-- Branch B</pre><p>If we need to talk about a particular commit, the character "o" may
be replaced with another letter or number.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="what-is-a-branch"></a>Understanding history: What is a branch?</h3></div></div></div><p>When we need to be precise, we will use the word "branch" to mean a line
of development, and "branch head" (or just "head") to mean a reference
to the most recent commit on a branch.  In the example above, the branch
head named "A" is a pointer to one particular commit, but we refer to
the line of three commits leading up to that point as all being part of
"branch A".</p><p>However, when no confusion will result, we often just use the term
"branch" both for branches and for branch heads.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="manipulating-branches"></a>Manipulating branches</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating, deleting, and modifying branches is quick and easy; here's
a summary of the commands:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">
git branch
</span></dt><dd>
        list all branches
</dd><dt><span class="term">
git branch &lt;branch&gt;
</span></dt><dd>
        create a new branch named &lt;branch&gt;, referencing the same
        point in history as the current branch
</dd><dt><span class="term">
git branch &lt;branch&gt; &lt;start-point&gt;
</span></dt><dd>
        create a new branch named &lt;branch&gt;, referencing
        &lt;start-point&gt;, which may be specified any way you like,
        including using a branch name or a tag name
</dd><dt><span class="term">
git branch -d &lt;branch&gt;
</span></dt><dd>
        delete the branch &lt;branch&gt;; if the branch you are deleting
        points to a commit which is not reachable from the current
        branch, this command will fail with a warning.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
git branch -D &lt;branch&gt;
</span></dt><dd>
        even if the branch points to a commit not reachable
        from the current branch, you may know that that commit
        is still reachable from some other branch or tag.  In that
        case it is safe to use this command to force git to delete
        the branch.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
git checkout &lt;branch&gt;
</span></dt><dd>
        make the current branch &lt;branch&gt;, updating the working
        directory to reflect the version referenced by &lt;branch&gt;
</dd><dt><span class="term">
git checkout -b &lt;new&gt; &lt;start-point&gt;

        create a new branch &lt;new&gt; referencing &lt;start-point&gt;, and
        check it out.
</dd></dl></div><p>The special symbol "HEAD" can always be used to refer to the current
branch.  In fact, git uses a file named "HEAD" in the .git directory to
remember which branch is current:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ cat .git/HEAD<br>
ref: refs/heads/master</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="detached-head"></a>Examining an old version without creating a new branch</h2></div></div></div><p>The git-checkout command normally expects a branch head, but will also
accept an arbitrary commit; for example, you can check out the commit
referenced by a tag:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout v2.6.17<br>
Note: moving to "v2.6.17" which isn't a local branch<br>
If you want to create a new branch from this checkout, you may do so<br>
(now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:<br>
  git checkout -b &lt;new_branch_name&gt;<br>
HEAD is now at 427abfa... Linux v2.6.17</p></div><p>The HEAD then refers to the SHA1 of the commit instead of to a branch,
and git branch shows that you are no longer on a branch:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ cat .git/HEAD<br>
427abfa28afedffadfca9dd8b067eb6d36bac53f<br>
$ git branch<br>
* (no branch)<br>
  master</p></div><p>In this case we say that the HEAD is "detached".</p><p>This is an easy way to check out a particular version without having to
make up a name for the new branch.   You can still create a new branch
(or tag) for this version later if you decide to.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="examining-remote-branches"></a>Examining branches from a remote repository</h2></div></div></div><p>The "master" branch that was created at the time you cloned is a copy
of the HEAD in the repository that you cloned from.  That repository
may also have had other branches, though, and your local repository
keeps branches which track each of those remote branches, which you
can view using the "-r" option to <a href="git-branch.html" target="_top">git-branch(1)</a>:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch -r<br>

  origin/man<br>
  origin/master<br>
  origin/next<br>
  origin/pu<br>
  origin/todo</p></div><p>You cannot check out these remote-tracking branches, but you can
examine them on a branch of your own, just as you would a tag:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout -b my-todo-copy origin/todo</p></div><p>Note that the name "origin" is just the name that git uses by default

commits.  All references are named with a slash-separated path name
starting with "refs"; the names we've been using so far are actually
shorthand:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
The branch "test" is short for "refs/heads/test".
</li><li>
The tag "v2.6.18" is short for "refs/tags/v2.6.18".
</li><li>
"origin/master" is short for "refs/remotes/origin/master".
</li></ul></div><p>The full name is occasionally useful if, for example, there ever
exists a tag and a branch with the same name.</p><p>(Newly created refs are actually stored in the .git/refs directory,
under the path given by their name.  However, for efficiency reasons
they may also be packed together in a single file; see
<a href="git-pack-refs.html" target="_top">git-pack-refs(1)</a>).</p><p>As another useful shortcut, the "HEAD" of a repository can be referred
to just using the name of that repository.  So, for example, "origin"
is usually a shortcut for the HEAD branch in the repository "origin".</p><p>For the complete list of paths which git checks for references, and
the order it uses to decide which to choose when there are multiple
references with the same shorthand name, see the "SPECIFYING

collection of files.  It does this by storing compressed snapshots of
the contents of a file hierarchy, together with "commits" which show
the relationships between these snapshots.</p><p>Git provides extremely flexible and fast tools for exploring the
history of a project.</p><p>We start with one specialized tool that is useful for finding the
commit that introduced a bug into a project.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="using-bisect"></a>How to use bisect to find a regression</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose version 2.6.18 of your project worked, but the version at
"master" crashes.  Sometimes the best way to find the cause of such a
regression is to perform a brute-force search through the project's
history to find the particular commit that caused the problem.  The
<a href="git-bisect.html" target="_top">git-bisect(1)</a> command can help you do this:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git bisect start<br>
$ git bisect good v2.6.18<br>
$ git bisect bad master<br>
Bisecting: 3537 revisions left to test after this<br>

temporarily moved you to a new branch named "bisect".  This branch
points to a commit (with commit id 65934…) that is reachable from
"master" but not from v2.6.18.  Compile and test it, and see whether
it crashes.  Assume it does crash.  Then:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git bisect bad<br>
Bisecting: 1769 revisions left to test after this<br>

stage whether the version it gives you is good or bad, and notice
that the number of revisions left to test is cut approximately in
half each time.</p><p>After about 13 tests (in this case), it will output the commit id of
the guilty commit.  You can then examine the commit with
<a href="git-show.html" target="_top">git-show(1)</a>, find out who wrote it, and mail them your bug
report with the commit id.  Finally, run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git bisect reset</p></div><p>to return you to the branch you were on before and delete the
temporary "bisect" branch.</p><p>Note that the version which git-bisect checks out for you at each
point is just a suggestion, and you're free to try a different
version if you think it would be a good idea.  For example,
occasionally you may land on a commit that broke something unrelated;
run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git bisect visualize</p></div><p>which will run gitk and label the commit it chose with a marker that
says "bisect".  Chose a safe-looking commit nearby, note its commit
id, and check it out with:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git reset --hard fb47ddb2db...</p></div><p>then test, run "bisect good" or "bisect bad" as appropriate, and
continue.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="naming-commits"></a>Naming commits</h2></div></div></div><p>We have seen several ways of naming commits already:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
40-hexdigit object name
</li><li>
branch name: refers to the commit at the head of the given
          branch
</li><li>
tag name: refers to the commit pointed to by the given tag
          (we've seen branches and tags are special cases of
          <a href="#how-git-stores-references" title="Naming branches, tags, and other references">references</a>).
</li><li>
HEAD: refers to the head of the current branch
</li></ul></div><p>There are many more; see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section of the
<a href="git-rev-parse.html" target="_top">git-rev-parse(1)</a> man page for the complete list of ways to
name revisions.  Some examples:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show fb47ddb2 # the first few characters of the object name<br>
                    # are usually enough to specify it uniquely<br>
$ git show HEAD^    # the parent of the HEAD commit<br>
$ git show HEAD^^   # the grandparent<br>
$ git show HEAD~4   # the great-great-grandparent</p></div><p>Recall that merge commits may have more than one parent; by default,
^ and ~ follow the first parent listed in the commit, but you can
also choose:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show HEAD^1   # show the first parent of HEAD<br>
$ git show HEAD^2   # show the second parent of HEAD</p></div><p>In addition to HEAD, there are several other special names for
commits:</p><p>Merges (to be discussed later), as well as operations such as
git-reset, which change the currently checked-out commit, generally
set ORIG_HEAD to the value HEAD had before the current operation.</p><p>The git-fetch operation always stores the head of the last fetched
branch in FETCH_HEAD.  For example, if you run git fetch without
specifying a local branch as the target of the operation</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git fetch git://example.com/proj.git theirbranch</p></div><p>the fetched commits will still be available from FETCH_HEAD.</p><p>When we discuss merges we'll also see the special name MERGE_HEAD,
which refers to the other branch that we're merging in to the current
branch.</p><p>The <a href="git-rev-parse.html" target="_top">git-rev-parse(1)</a> command is a low-level command that is
occasionally useful for translating some name for a commit to the object
name for that commit:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git rev-parse origin<br>

comment with the tag, and possibly sign it cryptographically, then you
should create a tag object instead; see the <a href="git-tag.html" target="_top">git-tag(1)</a> man page
for details.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="browsing-revisions"></a>Browsing revisions</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a href="git-log.html" target="_top">git-log(1)</a> command can show lists of commits.  On its
own, it shows all commits reachable from the parent commit; but you
can also make more specific requests:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log v2.5..        # commits since (not reachable from) v2.5<br>
$ git log test..master  # commits reachable from master but not test<br>
$ git log master..test  # ...reachable from test but not master<br>
$ git log master...test # ...reachable from either test or master,<br>
                        #    but not both<br>
$ git log --since="2 weeks ago" # commits from the last 2 weeks<br>
$ git log Makefile      # commits which modify Makefile<br>
$ git log fs/           # ... which modify any file under fs/<br>
$ git log -S'foo()'     # commits which add or remove any file data<br>
                        # matching the string 'foo()'</p></div><p>And of course you can combine all of these; the following finds
commits since v2.5 which touch the Makefile or any file under fs:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log v2.5.. Makefile fs/</p></div><p>You can also ask git log to show patches:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log -p</p></div><p>See the "—pretty" option in the <a href="git-log.html" target="_top">git-log(1)</a> man page for more
display options.</p><p>Note that git log starts with the most recent commit and works

commits are listed in may be somewhat arbitrary.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="generating-diffs"></a>Generating diffs</h2></div></div></div><p>You can generate diffs between any two versions using

descendants:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git name-rev --tags e05db0fd<br>
e05db0fd tags/v1.5.0-rc1^0~23</p></div><p>The <a href="git-describe.html" target="_top">git-describe(1)</a> command does the opposite, naming the

v1.5.0-rc0-260-ge05db0f</p></div><p>but that may sometimes help you guess which tags might come after the

and always returns one or the other in the case where one is a
descendant of the other; so the above output shows that e05db0fd
actually is an ancestor of v1.5.0-rc1.</p><p>Alternatively, note that</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log v1.5.0-rc1..e05db0fd</p></div><p>will produce empty output if and only if v1.5.0-rc1 includes e05db0fd,

the commits reachable from its arguments with a display on the left-hand
side that indicates which arguments that commit is reachable from.  So,
you can run something like</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show-branch e05db0fd v1.5.0-rc0 v1.5.0-rc1 v1.5.0-rc2<br>

Making some changes to the working directory using your
           favorite editor.
</li><li>
Telling git about your changes.
</li><li>
Creating the commit using the content you told git about
           in step 2.
</li></ol></div><p>In practice, you can interleave and repeat steps 1 and 2 as many
times as you want: in order to keep track of what you want committed
at step 3, git maintains a snapshot of the tree's contents in a
special staging area called "the index."</p><p>At the beginning, the content of the index will be identical to
that of the HEAD.  The command "git diff —cached", which shows
the difference between the HEAD and the index, should therefore
produce no output at that point.</p><p>Modifying the index is easy:</p><p>To update the index with the new contents of a modified file, use</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git add path/to/file</p></div><p>To add the contents of a new file to the index, use</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git add path/to/file</p></div><p>To remove a file from the index and from the working tree,</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git rm path/to/file</p></div><p>After each step you can verify that</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff --cached</p></div><p>always shows the difference between the HEAD and the index file—this
is what you'd commit if you created the commit now—and that</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff</p></div><p>shows the difference between the working tree and the index file.</p><p>Note that "git add" always adds just the current contents of a file
to the index; further changes to the same file will be ignored unless
you run git-add on the file again.</p><p>When you're ready, just run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git commit</p></div><p>and git will prompt you for a commit message and then create the new
commit.  Check to make sure it looks like what you expected with</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show</p></div><p>As a special shortcut,</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git commit -a</p></div><p>will update the index with any files that you've modified or removed
and create a commit, all in one step.</p><p>A number of commands are useful for keeping track of what you're
about to commit:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff --cached # difference between HEAD and the index; what<br>
                    # would be committed if you ran "commit" now.<br>
$ git diff          # difference between the index file and your<br>

                    # would be committed if you ran "commit -a" now.<br>
$ git status        # a brief per-file summary of the above.</p></div><p>You can also use <a href="git-gui.html" target="_top">git-gui(1)</a> to create commits, view changes in
the index and the working tree files, and individually select diff hunks
for inclusion in the index (by right-clicking on the diff hunk and
choosing "Stage Hunk For Commit").</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="creating-good-commit-messages"></a>Creating good commit messages</h2></div></div></div><p>Though not required, it's a good idea to begin the commit message
with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the
change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough
description.  Tools that turn commits into email, for example, use
the first line on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the
body.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ignoring-files"></a>Ignoring files</h2></div></div></div><p>A project will often generate files that you do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> want to track with git.
This typically includes files generated by a build process or temporary
backup files made by your editor. Of course, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> tracking files with git
is just a matter of <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> calling "<code class="literal">git add</code>" on them. But it quickly becomes
annoying to have these untracked files lying around; e.g. they make
"<code class="literal">git add .</code>" and "<code class="literal">git commit -a</code>" practically useless, and they keep
showing up in the output of "<code class="literal">git status</code>".</p><p>You can tell git to ignore certain files by creating a file called .gitignore
in the top level of your working directory, with contents such as:</p><div class="literallayout"><p># Lines starting with '#' are considered comments.<br>
# Ignore any file named foo.txt.<br>
foo.txt<br>
# Ignore (generated) html files,<br>
*.html<br>
# except foo.html which is maintained by hand.<br>
!foo.html<br>
# Ignore objects and archives.<br>
*.[oa]</p></div><p>See <a href="gitignore.html" target="_top">gitignore(5)</a> for a detailed explanation of the syntax.  You can
also place .gitignore files in other directories in your working tree, and they
will apply to those directories and their subdirectories.  The <code class="literal">.gitignore</code>
files can be added to your repository like any other files (just run <code class="literal">git add
.gitignore</code> and <code class="literal">git commit</code>, as usual), which is convenient when the exclude
patterns (such as patterns matching build output files) would also make sense
for other users who clone your repository.</p><p>If you wish the exclude patterns to affect only certain repositories
(instead of every repository for a given project), you may instead put
them in a file in your repository named .git/info/exclude, or in any file
specified by the <code class="literal">core.excludesfile</code> configuration variable.  Some git
commands can also take exclude patterns directly on the command line.
See <a href="gitignore.html" target="_top">gitignore(5)</a> for the details.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="how-to-merge"></a>How to merge</h2></div></div></div><p>You can rejoin two diverging branches of development using

branch.  If there are conflicts—for example, if the same file is
modified in two different ways in the remote branch and the local
branch—then you are warned; the output may look something like this:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git merge next<br>

Auto-merged file.txt<br>
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt<br>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</p></div><p>Conflict markers are left in the problematic files, and after
you resolve the conflicts manually, you can update the index
with the contents and run git commit, as you normally would when
creating a new file.</p><p>If you examine the resulting commit using gitk, you will see that it
has two parents, one pointing to the top of the current branch, and
one to the top of the other branch.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="resolving-a-merge"></a>Resolving a merge</h2></div></div></div><p>When a merge isn't resolved automatically, git leaves the index and
the working tree in a special state that gives you all the
information you need to help resolve the merge.</p><p>Files with conflicts are marked specially in the index, so until you
resolve the problem and update the index, <a href="git-commit.html" target="_top">git-commit(1)</a> will
fail:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git commit<br>
file.txt: needs merge</p></div><p>Also, <a href="git-status.html" target="_top">git-status(1)</a> will list those files as "unmerged", and the
files with conflicts will have conflict markers added, like this:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:file.txt<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 77976da35a11db4580b80ae27e8d65caf5208086:file.txt</p></div><p>All you need to do is edit the files to resolve the conflicts, and then</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git add file.txt<br>
$ git commit</p></div><p>Note that the commit message will already be filled in for you with
some information about the merge.  Normally you can just use this
default message unchanged, but you may add additional commentary of
your own if desired.</p><p>The above is all you need to know to resolve a simple merge.  But git
also provides more information to help resolve conflicts:</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="conflict-resolution"></a>Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge</h3></div></div></div><p>All of the changes that git was able to merge automatically are
already added to the index file, so <a href="git-diff.html" target="_top">git-diff(1)</a> shows only
the conflicts.  It uses an unusual syntax:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff<br>

conflict will have two parents instead of the usual one: one parent
will be HEAD, the tip of the current branch; the other will be the
tip of the other branch, which is stored temporarily in MERGE_HEAD.</p><p>During the merge, the index holds three versions of each file.  Each of
these three "file stages" represents a different version of the file:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show :1:file.txt  # the file in a common ancestor of both branches<br>
$ git show :2:file.txt  # the version from HEAD.<br>
$ git show :3:file.txt  # the version from MERGE_HEAD.</p></div><p>When you ask <a href="git-diff.html" target="_top">git-diff(1)</a> to show the conflicts, it runs a
three-way diff between the conflicted merge results in the work tree with
stages 2 and 3 to show only hunks whose contents come from both sides,
mixed (in other words, when a hunk's merge results come only from stage 2,
that part is not conflicting and is not shown.  Same for stage 3).</p><p>The diff above shows the differences between the working-tree version of
file.txt and the stage 2 and stage 3 versions.  So instead of preceding
each line by a single "+" or "-", it now uses two columns: the first
column is used for differences between the first parent and the working
directory copy, and the second for differences between the second parent
and the working directory copy.  (See the "COMBINED DIFF FORMAT" section
of <a href="git-diff-files.html" target="_top">git-diff-files(1)</a> for a details of the format.)</p><p>After resolving the conflict in the obvious way (but before updating the
index), the diff will look like:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff<br>

++Goodbye world</p></div><p>This shows that our resolved version deleted "Hello world" from the
first parent, deleted "Goodbye" from the second parent, and added
"Goodbye world", which was previously absent from both.</p><p>Some special diff options allow diffing the working directory against
any of these stages:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff -1 file.txt          # diff against stage 1<br>
$ git diff --base file.txt      # same as the above<br>

$ git diff -3 file.txt          # diff against stage 3<br>
$ git diff --theirs file.txt    # same as the above.</p></div><p>The <a href="git-log.html" target="_top">git-log(1)</a> and gitk[1] commands also provide special help
for merges:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log --merge<br>
$ gitk --merge</p></div><p>These will display all commits which exist only on HEAD or on
MERGE_HEAD, and which touch an unmerged file.</p><p>You may also use <a href="git-mergetool.html" target="_top">git-mergetool(1)</a>, which lets you merge the
unmerged files using external tools such as emacs or kdiff3.</p><p>Each time you resolve the conflicts in a file and update the index:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git add file.txt</p></div><p>the different stages of that file will be "collapsed", after which

may wish to check the original repository for updates and merge them
into your own work.</p><p>We have already seen <a href="#Updating-a-repository-with-git-fetch" title="Updating a repository with git fetch">how to keep remote tracking branches up to date</a> with <a href="git-fetch.html" target="_top">git-fetch(1)</a>,
and how to merge two branches.  So you can merge in changes from the
original repository's master branch with:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git fetch<br>
$ git merge origin/master</p></div><p>However, the <a href="git-pull.html" target="_top">git-pull(1)</a> command provides a way to do this in
one step:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git pull origin master</p></div><p>In fact, if you have "master" checked out, then by default "git pull"
merges from the HEAD branch of the origin repository.  So often you can
accomplish the above with just a simple</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git pull</p></div><p>More generally, a branch that is created from a remote branch will pull
by default from that branch.  See the descriptions of the
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge options in
<a href="git-config.html" target="_top">git-config(1)</a>, and the discussion of the <code class="literal">—track</code> option in
<a href="git-checkout.html" target="_top">git-checkout(1)</a>, to learn how to control these defaults.</p><p>In addition to saving you keystrokes, "git pull" also helps you by
producing a default commit message documenting the branch and
repository that you pulled from.</p><p>(But note that no such commit will be created in the case of a
<a href="#fast-forwards" title="Fast-forward merges">fast forward</a>; instead, your branch will just be
updated to point to the latest commit from the upstream branch.)</p><p>The git-pull command can also be given "." as the "remote" repository,
in which case it just merges in a branch from the current repository; so
the commands</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git pull . branch<br>

for each patch in the current branch but not in origin/HEAD.</p><p>You can then import these into your mail client and send them by
hand.  However, if you have a lot to send at once, you may prefer to
use the <a href="git-send-email.html" target="_top">git-send-email(1)</a> script to automate the process.
Consult the mailing list for your project first to determine how they
prefer such patches be handled.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="importing-patches"></a>Importing patches to a project</h2></div></div></div><p>Git also provides a tool called <a href="git-am.html" target="_top">git-am(1)</a> (am stands for
"apply mailbox"), for importing such an emailed series of patches.
Just save all of the patch-containing messages, in order, into a
single mailbox file, say "patches.mbox", then run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git am -3 patches.mbox</p></div><p>Git will apply each patch in order; if any conflicts are found, it
will stop, and you can fix the conflicts as described in
"<a href="#resolving-a-merge" title="Resolving a merge">Resolving a merge</a>".  (The "-3" option tells
git to perform a merge; if you would prefer it just to abort and
leave your tree and index untouched, you may omit that option.)</p><p>Once the index is updated with the results of the conflict
resolution, instead of creating a new commit, just run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git am --resolved</p></div><p>and git will create the commit for you and continue applying the
remaining patches from the mailbox.</p><p>The final result will be a series of commits, one for each patch in
the original mailbox, with authorship and commit log message each
taken from the message containing each patch.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="public-repositories"></a>Public git repositories</h2></div></div></div><p>Another way to submit changes to a project is to tell the maintainer
of that project to pull the changes from your repository using
<a href="git-pull.html" target="_top">git-pull(1)</a>.  In the section "<a href="#getting-updates-with-git-pull" title="Getting updates with git pull">Getting updates with git pull</a>" we described this as a way to get
updates from the "main" repository, but it works just as well in the
other direction.</p><p>If you and the maintainer both have accounts on the same machine, then
you can just pull changes from each other's repositories directly;
commands that accept repository URLs as arguments will also accept a
local directory name:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git clone /path/to/repository<br>
$ git pull /path/to/other/repository</p></div><p>or an ssh URL:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git clone ssh://yourhost/~you/repository</p></div><p>For projects with few developers, or for synchronizing a few private
repositories, this may be all you need.</p><p>However, the more common way to do this is to maintain a separate public
repository (usually on a different host) for others to pull changes
from.  This is usually more convenient, and allows you to cleanly
separate private work in progress from publicly visible work.</p><p>You will continue to do your day-to-day work in your personal
repository, but periodically "push" changes from your personal
repository into your public repository, allowing other developers to
pull from that repository.  So the flow of changes, in a situation
where there is one other developer with a public repository, looks
like this:</p><pre class="literallayout">                      you push

is meant to be public:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git clone --bare ~/proj proj.git<br>
$ touch proj.git/git-daemon-export-ok</p></div><p>The resulting directory proj.git contains a "bare" git repository—it is
just the contents of the ".git" directory, without any files checked out
around it.</p><p>Next, copy proj.git to the server where you plan to host the
public repository.  You can use scp, rsync, or whatever is most
convenient.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="exporting-via-git"></a>Exporting a git repository via the git protocol</h3></div></div></div><p>This is the preferred method.</p><p>If someone else administers the server, they should tell you what

listen on port 9418.  By default, it will allow access to any directory

arguments will further restrict the exports to those paths.</p><p>You can also run git-daemon as an inetd service; see the

a directory that is exported by the web server, and make some
adjustments to give web clients some extra information they need:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ mv proj.git /home/you/public_html/proj.git<br>

latest changes created in your private repository.</p><p>The simplest way to do this is using <a href="git-push.html" target="_top">git-push(1)</a> and ssh; to
update the remote branch named "master" with the latest state of your

repository that has a checked-out working tree, but the working tree
will not be updated by the push.  This may lead to unexpected results if
the branch you push to is the currently checked-out branch!</p><p>As with git-fetch, you may also set up configuration options to
save typing; so, for example, after</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ cat &gt;&gt;.git/config &lt;&lt;EOF<br>

 Maybe you are not up-to-date and need to pull first?<br>
error: failed to push to 'ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git'</p></div><p>This can happen, for example, if you:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
use <code class="literal">git reset —hard</code> to remove already-published commits, or
</li><li>
use <code class="literal">git commit —amend</code> to replace already-published commits
          (as in <a href="#fixing-a-mistake-by-rewriting-history" title="Fixing a mistake by rewriting history">the section called “Fixing a mistake by rewriting history”</a>), or
</li><li>
use <code class="literal">git rebase</code> to rebase any already-published commits (as
          in <a href="#using-git-rebase" title="Keeping a patch series up to date using git-rebase">the section called “Keeping a patch series up to date using git-rebase”</a>).
</li></ul></div><p>You may force git-push to perform the update anyway by preceding the
branch name with a plus sign:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git +master</p></div><p>Normally whenever a branch head in a public repository is modified, it
is modified to point to a descendant of the commit that it pointed to
before.  By forcing a push in this situation, you break that convention.
(See <a href="#problems-with-rewriting-history" title="Problems with rewriting history">the section called “Problems with rewriting history”</a>.)</p><p>Nevertheless, this is a common practice for people that need a simple
way to publish a work-in-progress patch series, and it is an acceptable
compromise as long as you warn other developers that this is how you
intend to manage the branch.</p><p>It's also possible for a push to fail in this way when other people have
the right to push to the same repository.  In that case, the correct
solution is to retry the push after first updating your work by either a
pull or a fetch followed by a rebase; see the
<a href="#setting-up-a-shared-repository" title="Setting up a shared repository">next section</a> and
<a href="gitcvs-migration.html" target="_top">gitcvs-migration(7)</a>[git for CVS users] for more.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setting-up-a-shared-repository"></a>Setting up a shared repository</h3></div></div></div><p>Another way to collaborate is by using a model similar to that
commonly used in CVS, where several developers with special rights
all push to and pull from a single shared repository.  See
<a href="gitcvs-migration.html" target="_top">gitcvs-migration(7)</a>[git for CVS users] for instructions on how to
set this up.</p><p>However, while there is nothing wrong with git's support for shared
repositories, this mode of operation is not generally recommended,
simply because the mode of collaboration that git supports—by
exchanging patches and pulling from public repositories—has so many
advantages over the central shared repository:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
Git's ability to quickly import and merge patches allows a
          single maintainer to process incoming changes even at very
          high rates.  And when that becomes too much, git-pull provides
          an easy way for that maintainer to delegate this job to other
          maintainers while still allowing optional review of incoming
          changes.
</li><li>
Since every developer's repository has the same complete copy
          of the project history, no repository is special, and it is
          trivial for another developer to take over maintenance of a
          project, either by mutual agreement, or because a maintainer
          becomes unresponsive or difficult to work with.
</li><li>
The lack of a central group of "committers" means there is
          less need for formal decisions about who is "in" and who is

   him a "please pull" request.)
</li></ul></div><p>He also uses a set of temporary branches ("topic branches"), each
containing a logical grouping of patches.</p><p>To set this up, first create your work tree by cloning Linus's public
tree:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git work<br>
$ cd work</p></div><p>Linus's tree will be stored in the remote branch named origin/master,
and can be updated using <a href="git-fetch.html" target="_top">git-fetch(1)</a>; you can track other
public trees using <a href="git-remote.html" target="_top">git-remote(1)</a> to set up a "remote" and
<a href="git-fetch.html" target="_top">git-fetch(1)</a> to keep them up-to-date; see
<a href="#repositories-and-branches" title="Chapter 1. Repositories and Branches">Chapter 1, <i>Repositories and Branches</i></a>.</p><p>Now create the branches in which you are going to work; these start out
at the current tip of origin/master branch, and should be set up (using
the —track option to <a href="git-branch.html" target="_top">git-branch(1)</a>) to merge changes in from
Linus by default.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch --track test origin/master<br>
$ git branch --track release origin/master</p></div><p>These can be easily kept up to date using <a href="git-pull.html" target="_top">git-pull(1)</a>.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout test &amp;&amp; git pull<br>
$ git checkout release &amp;&amp; git pull</p></div><p>Important note!  If you have any local changes in these branches, then
this merge will create a commit object in the history (with no local
changes git will simply do a "Fast forward" merge).  Many people dislike
the "noise" that this creates in the Linux history, so you should avoid
doing this capriciously in the "release" branch, as these noisy commits
will become part of the permanent history when you ask Linus to pull
from the release branch.</p><p>A few configuration variables (see <a href="git-config.html" target="_top">git-config(1)</a>) can
make it easy to push both branches to your public tree.  (See
<a href="#setting-up-a-public-repository" title="Setting up a public repository">the section called “Setting up a public repository”</a>.)</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ cat &gt;&gt; .git/config &lt;&lt;EOF<br>

        push = release<br>
        push = test<br>

<a href="git-push.html" target="_top">git-push(1)</a>:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git push mytree</p></div><p>or push just one of the test and release branches using:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git push mytree test</p></div><p>or</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git push mytree release</p></div><p>Now to apply some patches from the community.  Think of a short
snappy name for a branch to hold this patch (or related group of
patches), and create a new branch from the current tip of Linus's
branch:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout -b speed-up-spinlocks origin</p></div><p>Now you apply the patch(es), run some tests, and commit the change(s).  If
the patch is a multi-part series, then you should apply each as a separate
commit to this branch.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ ... patch ... test  ... commit [ ... patch ... test ... commit ]*</p></div><p>When you are happy with the state of this change, you can pull it into the
"test" branch in preparation to make it public:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout test &amp;&amp; git pull . speed-up-spinlocks</p></div><p>It is unlikely that you would have any conflicts here … but you might if you
spent a while on this step and had also pulled new versions from upstream.</p><p>Some time later when enough time has passed and testing done, you can pull the
same branch into the "release" tree ready to go upstream.  This is where you
see the value of keeping each patch (or patch series) in its own branch.  It
means that the patches can be moved into the "release" tree in any order.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout release &amp;&amp; git pull . speed-up-spinlocks</p></div><p>After a while, you will have a number of branches, and despite the
well chosen names you picked for each of them, you may forget what
they are for, or what status they are in.  To get a reminder of what
changes are in a specific branch, use:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log linux..branchname | git-shortlog</p></div><p>To see whether it has already been merged into the test or release branches,
use:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log test..branchname</p></div><p>or</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log release..branchname</p></div><p>(If this branch has not yet been merged, you will see some log entries.
If it has been merged, then there will be no output.)</p><p>Once a patch completes the great cycle (moving from test to release,
then pulled by Linus, and finally coming back into your local
"origin/master" branch), the branch for this change is no longer needed.
You detect this when the output from:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log origin..branchname</p></div><p>is empty.  At this point the branch can be deleted:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch -d branchname</p></div><p>Some changes are so trivial that it is not necessary to create a separate
branch and then merge into each of the test and release branches.  For
these changes, just apply directly to the "release" branch, and then
merge that into the "test" branch.</p><p>To create diffstat and shortlog summaries of changes to include in a "please
pull" request to Linus you can use:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff --stat origin..release</p></div><p>and</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log -p origin..release | git shortlog</p></div><p>Here are some of the scripts that simplify all this even further.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>==== update script ====<br>

may find that it is too much to digest all at once.</p><p>If you present them with the entire history of your work, complete with

Each patch includes a single logical change, together with a

series of patches on top of "origin", you might do something like:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout -b mywork-new origin<br>
$ gitk origin..mywork &amp;</p></div><p>and browse through the list of patches in the mywork branch using gitk,

cherry-pick, and possibly modifying them as you go using <code class="literal">commit —amend</code>.

with merging.  Suppose somebody fetches your branch and merges it into
their branch, with a result something like this:</p><pre class="literallayout"> o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
        \        \
         t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre><p>Then suppose you modify the last three commits:</p><pre class="literallayout">         o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
        /
 o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin</pre><p>If we examined all this history together in one repository, it will
look like:</p><pre class="literallayout">         o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
        /
 o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin
        \        \
         t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre><p>Git has no way of knowing that the new head is an updated version of
the old head; it treats this situation exactly the same as it would if
two developers had independently done the work on the old and new heads
in parallel.  At this point, if someone attempts to merge the new head
in to their branch, git will attempt to merge together the two (old and
new) lines of development, instead of trying to replace the old by the
new.  The results are likely to be unexpected.</p><p>You may still choose to publish branches whose history is rewritten,
and it may be useful for others to be able to fetch those branches in
order to examine or test them, but they should not attempt to pull such
branches into their own work.</p><p>For true distributed development that supports proper merging,
published branches should never be rewritten.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="bisect-merges"></a>Why bisecting merge commits can be harder than bisecting linear history</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a href="git-bisect.html" target="_top">git-bisect(1)</a> command correctly handles history that
includes merge commits.  However, when the commit that it finds is a
merge commit, the user may need to work harder than usual to figure out
why that commit introduced a problem.</p><p>Imagine this history:</p><pre class="literallayout">      ---Z---o---X---...---o---A---C---D
          \                       /
           o---o---Y---...---o---B</pre><p>Suppose that on the upper line of development, the meaning of one
of the functions that exists at Z is changed at commit X.  The
commits from Z leading to A change both the function's
implementation and all calling sites that exist at Z, as well
as new calling sites they add, to be consistent.  There is no
bug at A.</p><p>Suppose that in the meantime on the lower line of development somebody
adds a new calling site for that function at commit Y.  The
commits from Z leading to B all assume the old semantics of that
function and the callers and the callee are consistent with each
other.  There is no bug at B, either.</p><p>Suppose further that the two development lines merge cleanly at C,
so no conflict resolution is required.</p><p>Nevertheless, the code at C is broken, because the callers added
on the lower line of development have not been converted to the new
semantics introduced on the upper line of development.  So if all
you know is that D is bad, that Z is good, and that
<a href="git-bisect.html" target="_top">git-bisect(1)</a> identifies C as the culprit, how will you
figure out that the problem is due to this change in semantics?</p><p>When the result of a git-bisect is a non-merge commit, you should
normally be able to discover the problem by examining just that commit.
Developers can make this easy by breaking their changes into small
self-contained commits.  That won't help in the case above, however,
because the problem isn't obvious from examination of any single
commit; instead, a global view of the development is required.  To
make matters worse, the change in semantics in the problematic
function may be just one small part of the changes in the upper
line of development.</p><p>On the other hand, if instead of merging at C you had rebased the
history between Z to B on top of A, you would have gotten this
linear history:</p><pre class="literallayout">    ---Z---o---X--...---o---A---o---o---Y*--...---o---B*--D*</pre><p>Bisecting between Z and D* would hit a single culprit commit Y*,
and understanding why Y* was broken would probably be easier.</p><p>Partly for this reason, many experienced git users, even when
working on an otherwise merge-heavy project, keep the history
linear by rebasing against the latest upstream version before
publishing.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="advanced-branch-management"></a>Chapter 6. Advanced branch management</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#fetching-individual-branches">Fetching individual branches</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#fetch-fast-forwards">git fetch and fast-forwards</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#forcing-fetch">Forcing git fetch to do non-fast-forward updates</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#remote-branch-configuration">Configuring remote branches</a></span></dt></dl></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="fetching-individual-branches"></a>Fetching individual branches</h2></div></div></div><p>Instead of using <a href="git-remote.html" target="_top">git-remote(1)</a>, you can also choose just

commit.  Git calls this process a <a href="#fast-forwards" title="Fast-forward merges">fast forward</a>.</p><p>A fast forward looks something like this:</p><pre class="literallayout"> o--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of the branch

            o--o--o &lt;-- new head of the branch</pre><p>In some cases it is possible that the new head will <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span> actually be
a descendant of the old head.  For example, the developer may have
realized she made a serious mistake, and decided to backtrack,
resulting in a situation like:</p><pre class="literallayout"> o--o--o--o--a--b &lt;-- old head of the branch
           \
            o--o--o &lt;-- new head of the branch</pre><p>In this case, "git fetch" will fail, and print out a warning.</p><p>In that case, you can still force git to update to the new head, as
described in the following section.  However, note that in the
situation above this may mean losing the commits labeled "a" and "b",
unless you've already created a reference of your own pointing to
them.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="forcing-fetch"></a>Forcing git fetch to do non-fast-forward updates</h2></div></div></div><p>If git fetch fails because the new head of a branch is not a

While it
is possible to get things done without understanding them, you will find
git much more intuitive if you do.</p><p>We start with the most important, the  <a href="#def_object_database">object database</a> and the <a href="#def_index">index</a>.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="the-object-database"></a>The Object Database</h2></div></div></div><p>We already saw in <a href="#understanding-commits" title="Understanding History: Commits">the section called “Understanding History: Commits”</a> that all commits are stored
under a 40-digit "object name".  In fact, all the information needed to
represent the history of a project is stored in objects with such names.
In each case the name is calculated by taking the SHA1 hash of the
contents of the object.  The SHA1 hash is a cryptographic hash function.
What that means to us is that it is impossible to find two different
objects with the same name.  This has a number of advantages; among
others:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
Git can quickly determine whether two objects are identical or not,
  just by comparing names.
</li><li>
Since object names are computed the same way in every repository, the
  same content stored in two repositories will always be stored under
  the same name.
</li><li>
Git can detect errors when it reads an object, by checking that the
  object's name is still the SHA1 hash of its contents.
</li></ul></div><p>(See <a href="#object-details" title="Object storage format">the section called “Object storage format”</a> for the details of the object formatting and
SHA1 calculation.)</p><p>There are four different types of objects: "blob", "tree", "commit", and
"tag".</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
A <a href="#def_blob_object">"blob" object</a> is used to store file data.
</li><li>
A <a href="#def_tree_object">"tree" object</a> is an object that ties one or more
  "blob" objects into a directory structure. In addition, a tree object
  can refer to other tree objects, thus creating a directory hierarchy.
</li><li>
A <a href="#def_commit_object">"commit" object</a> ties such directory hierarchies
  together into a <a href="#def_DAG">directed acyclic graph</a> of revisions—each
  commit contains the object name of exactly one tree designating the
  directory hierarchy at the time of the commit. In addition, a commit
  refers to "parent" commit objects that describe the history of how we
  arrived at that directory hierarchy.
</li><li>
A <a href="#def_tag_object">"tag" object</a> symbolically identifies and can be
  used to sign other objects. It contains the object name and type of
  another object, a symbolic name (of course!) and, optionally, a
  signature.

a tree: The SHA1 name of a tree object (as defined below), representing

parent(s): The SHA1 name of some number of commits which represent the
  immediately previous step(s) in the history of the project.  The
  example above has one parent; merge commits may have more than
  one.  A commit with no parents is called a "root" commit, and

an author: The name of the person responsible for this change, together

a committer: The name of the person who actually created the commit,

mode, object type, SHA1 name, and name, sorted by name.  It represents
the contents of a single directory tree.</p><p>The object type may be a blob, representing the contents of a file, or
another tree, representing the contents of a subdirectory.  Since trees
and blobs, like all other objects, are named by the SHA1 hash of their
contents, two trees have the same SHA1 name if and only if their
contents (including, recursively, the contents of all subdirectories)
are identical.  This allows git to quickly determine the differences
between two related tree objects, since it can ignore any entries with
identical object names.</p><p>(Note: in the presence of submodules, trees may also have commits as
entries.  See <a href="#submodules" title="Chapter 8. Submodules">Chapter 8, <i>Submodules</i></a> for documentation.)</p><p>Note that the files all have mode 644 or 755: git actually only pays

...</p></div><p>A "blob" object is nothing but a binary blob of data.  It doesn't refer
to anything else or have attributes of any kind.</p><p>Since the blob is entirely defined by its data, if two files in a
directory tree (or in multiple different versions of the repository)
have the same contents, they will share the same blob object. The object
is totally independent of its location in the directory tree, and
renaming a file does not change the object that file is associated with.</p><p>Note that any tree or blob object can be examined using
<a href="git-show.html" target="_top">git-show(1)</a> with the &lt;revision&gt;:&lt;path&gt; syntax.  This can
sometimes be useful for browsing the contents of a tree that is not
currently checked out.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="trust"></a>Trust</h3></div></div></div><p>If you receive the SHA1 name of a blob from one source, and its contents
from another (possibly untrusted) source, you can still trust that those
contents are correct as long as the SHA1 name agrees.  This is because
the SHA1 is designed so that it is infeasible to find different contents
that produce the same hash.</p><p>Similarly, you need only trust the SHA1 name of a top-level tree object
to trust the contents of the entire directory that it refers to, and if
you receive the SHA1 name of a commit from a trusted source, then you
can easily verify the entire history of commits reachable through
parents of that commit, and all of those contents of the trees referred
to by those commits.</p><p>So to introduce some real trust in the system, the only thing you need
to do is to digitally sign just <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> special note, which includes the
name of a top-level commit.  Your digital signature shows others
that you trust that commit, and the immutability of the history of
commits tells others that they can trust the whole history.</p><p>In other words, you can easily validate a whole archive by just
sending out a single email that tells the people the name (SHA1 hash)
of the top commit, and digitally sign that email using something
like GPG/PGP.</p><p>To assist in this, git also provides the tag object…</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tag-object"></a>Tag Object</h3></div></div></div><p>A tag object contains an object, object type, tag name, the name of the

object's SHA1 hash (stored in .git/objects).</p><p>Unfortunately this system becomes inefficient once a project has a
lot of objects.  Try this on an old project:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git count-objects<br>
6930 objects, 47620 kilobytes</p></div><p>The first number is the number of objects which are kept in
individual files.  The second is the amount of space taken up by
those "loose" objects.</p><p>You can save space and make git faster by moving these loose objects in
to a "pack file", which stores a group of objects in an efficient
compressed format; the details of how pack files are formatted can be
found in <a href="technical/pack-format.txt" target="_top">technical/pack-format.txt</a>.</p><p>To put the loose objects into a pack, just run git repack:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git repack<br>

pack.  This will also remove any unreferenced objects (which may be
created when, for example, you use "git reset" to remove a commit).
You can verify that the loose objects are gone by looking at the
.git/objects directory or by running</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git count-objects<br>
0 objects, 0 kilobytes</p></div><p>Although the object files are gone, any commands that refer to those
objects will work exactly as they did before.</p><p>The <a href="git-gc.html" target="_top">git-gc(1)</a> command performs packing, pruning, and more for
you, so is normally the only high-level command you need.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dangling-objects"></a>Dangling objects</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a href="git-fsck.html" target="_top">git-fsck(1)</a> command will sometimes complain about dangling
objects.  They are not a problem.</p><p>The most common cause of dangling objects is that you've rebased a
branch, or you have pulled from somebody else who rebased a branch—see
<a href="#cleaning-up-history" title="Chapter 5. Rewriting history and maintaining patch series">Chapter 5, <i>Rewriting history and maintaining patch series</i></a>.  In that case, the old head of the original
branch still exists, as does everything it pointed to. The branch
pointer itself just doesn't, since you replaced it with another one.</p><p>There are also other situations that cause dangling objects. For
example, a "dangling blob" may arise because you did a "git add" of a
file, but then, before you actually committed it and made it part of the
bigger picture, you changed something else in that file and committed
that <span class="strong"><strong>updated</strong></span> thing—the old state that you added originally ends up
not being pointed to by any commit or tree, so it's now a dangling blob
object.</p><p>Similarly, when the "recursive" merge strategy runs, and finds that
there are criss-cross merges and thus more than one merge base (which is
fairly unusual, but it does happen), it will generate one temporary
midway tree (or possibly even more, if you had lots of criss-crossing
merges and more than two merge bases) as a temporary internal merge
base, and again, those are real objects, but the end result will not end
up pointing to them, so they end up "dangling" in your repository.</p><p>Generally, dangling objects aren't anything to worry about. They can
even be very useful: if you screw something up, the dangling objects can
be how you recover your old tree (say, you did a rebase, and realized
that you really didn't want to—you can look at what dangling objects
you have, and decide to reset your head to some old dangling state).</p><p>For commits, you can just use:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ gitk &lt;dangling-commit-sha-goes-here&gt; --not --all</p></div><p>This asks for all the history reachable from the given commit but not
from any branch, tag, or other reference.  If you decide it's something
you want, you can always create a new reference to it, e.g.,</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch recovered-branch &lt;dangling-commit-sha-goes-here&gt;</p></div><p>For blobs and trees, you can't do the same, but you can still examine
them.  You can just do</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show &lt;dangling-blob/tree-sha-goes-here&gt;</p></div><p>to show what the contents of the blob were (or, for a tree, basically
what the "ls" for that directory was), and that may give you some idea
of what the operation was that left that dangling object.</p><p>Usually, dangling blobs and trees aren't very interesting. They're
almost always the result of either being a half-way mergebase (the blob
will often even have the conflict markers from a merge in it, if you
have had conflicting merges that you fixed up by hand), or simply
because you interrupted a "git fetch" with ^C or something like that,
leaving _some_ of the new objects in the object database, but just
dangling and useless.</p><p>Anyway, once you are sure that you're not interested in any dangling
state, you can just prune all unreachable objects:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git prune</p></div><p>and they'll be gone. But you should only run "git prune" on a quiescent
repository—it's kind of like doing a filesystem fsck recovery: you
don't want to do that while the filesystem is mounted.</p><p>(The same is true of "git-fsck" itself, btw, but since
git-fsck never actually <span class="strong"><strong>changes</strong></span> the repository, it just reports
on what it found, git-fsck itself is never "dangerous" to run.
Running it while somebody is actually changing the repository can cause
confusing and scary messages, but it won't actually do anything bad. In
contrast, running "git prune" while somebody is actively changing the
repository is a <span class="strong"><strong>BAD</strong></span> idea).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="recovering-from-repository-corruption"></a>Recovering from repository corruption</h3></div></div></div><p>By design, git treats data trusted to it with caution.  However, even in
the absence of bugs in git itself, it is still possible that hardware or
operating system errors could corrupt data.</p><p>The first defense against such problems is backups.  You can back up a
git directory using clone, or just using cp, tar, or any other backup
mechanism.</p><p>As a last resort, you can search for the corrupted objects and attempt
to replace them by hand.  Back up your repository before attempting this
in case you corrupt things even more in the process.</p><p>We'll assume that the problem is a single missing or corrupted blob,
which is sometimes a solvable problem.  (Recovering missing trees and
especially commits is <span class="strong"><strong>much</strong></span> harder).</p><p>Before starting, verify that there is corruption, and figure out where
it is with <a href="git-fsck.html" target="_top">git-fsck(1)</a>; this may be time-consuming.</p><p>Assume the output looks like this:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-fsck --full<br>

aren't interesting.)</p><p>Now you know that blob 4b9458b3 is missing, and that the tree 2d9263c6
points to it.  If you could find just one copy of that missing blob
object, possibly in some other repository, you could move it into
.git/objects/4b/9458b3… and be done.  Suppose you can't.  You can

"current directory cache" or just the "cache".  It has three important
properties:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The index contains all the information necessary to generate a single
(uniquely determined) tree object.
</p><p>For example, running <a href="git-commit.html" target="_top">git-commit(1)</a> generates this tree object
from the index, stores it in the object database, and uses it as the
tree object associated with the new commit.</p></li><li><p>
The index enables fast comparisons between the tree object it defines
and the working tree.
</p><p>It does this by storing some additional data for each entry (such as
the last modified time).  This data is not displayed above, and is not
stored in the created tree object, but it can be used to determine
quickly which files in the working directory differ from what was
stored in the index, and thus save git from having to read all of the
data from such files to look for changes.</p></li><li><p>
It can efficiently represent information about merge conflicts
between different tree objects, allowing each pathname to be
associated with sufficient information about the trees involved that
you can create a three-way merge between them.
</p><p>We saw in <a href="#conflict-resolution" title="Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge">the section called “Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge”</a> that during a merge the index can
store multiple versions of a single file (called "stages").  The third
column in the <a href="git-ls-files.html" target="_top">git-ls-files(1)</a> output above is the stage
number, and will take on values other than 0 for files with merge
conflicts.</p></li></ol></div><p>The index is thus a sort of temporary staging area, which is filled with
a tree which you are in the process of working on.</p><p>If you blow the index away entirely, you generally haven't lost any
information as long as you have the name of the tree that it described.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="submodules"></a>Chapter 8. Submodules</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#id280264">Pitfalls with submodules</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>Large projects are often composed of smaller, self-contained modules.  For
example, an embedded Linux distribution's source tree would include every
piece of software in the distribution with some local modifications; a movie
player might need to build against a specific, known-working version of a
decompression library; several independent programs might all share the same
build scripts.</p><p>With centralized revision control systems this is often accomplished by
including every module in one single repository.  Developers can check out
all modules or only the modules they need to work with.  They can even modify
files across several modules in a single commit while moving things around
or updating APIs and translations.</p><p>Git does not allow partial checkouts, so duplicating this approach in Git
would force developers to keep a local copy of modules they are not
interested in touching.  Commits in an enormous checkout would be slower
than you'd expect as Git would have to scan every directory for changes.
If modules have a lot of local history, clones would take forever.</p><p>On the plus side, distributed revision control systems can much better
integrate with external sources.  In a centralized model, a single arbitrary
snapshot of the external project is exported from its own revision control
and then imported into the local revision control on a vendor branch.  All
the history is hidden.  With distributed revision control you can clone the
entire external history and much more easily follow development and re-merge
local changes.</p><p>Git's submodule support allows a repository to contain, as a subdirectory, a
checkout of an external project.  Submodules maintain their own identity;
the submodule support just stores the submodule repository location and
commit ID, so other developers who clone the containing project
("superproject") can easily clone all the submodules at the same revision.
Partial checkouts of the superproject are possible: you can tell Git to
clone none, some or all of the submodules.</p><p>The <a href="git-submodule.html" target="_top">git-submodule(1)</a> command is available since Git 1.5.3.  Users
with Git 1.5.2 can look up the submodule commits in the repository and
manually check them out; earlier versions won't recognize the submodules at
all.</p><p>To see how submodule support works, create (for example) four example
repositories that can be used later as a submodule:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ mkdir ~/git<br>
$ cd ~/git<br>
$ for i in a b c d<br>

        git add $i.txt<br>
        git commit -m "Initial commit, submodule $i"<br>
        cd ..<br>
done</p></div><p>Now create the superproject and add all the submodules:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ mkdir super<br>

<a href="git-checkout.html" target="_top">git-checkout(1)</a> and <a href="git-reset.html" target="_top">git-reset(1)</a> work by moving data
between the working tree, the index, and the object database.  Git
provides low-level operations which perform each of these steps
individually.</p><p>Generally, all "git" operations work on the index file. Some operations
work <span class="strong"><strong>purely</strong></span> on the index file (showing the current state of the
index), but most operations move data between the index file and either
the database or the working directory. Thus there are four main
combinations:</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="working-directory-to-index"></a>working directory -&gt; index</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a href="git-update-index.html" target="_top">git-update-index(1)</a> command updates the index with
information from the working directory.  You generally update the
index information by just specifying the filename you want to update,
like so:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git update-index filename</p></div><p>but to avoid common mistakes with filename globbing etc, the command
will not normally add totally new entries or remove old entries,
i.e. it will normally just update existing cache entries.</p><p>To tell git that yes, you really do realize that certain files no
longer exist, or that new files should be added, you
should use the <code class="literal">—remove</code> and <code class="literal">—add</code> flags respectively.</p><p>NOTE! A <code class="literal">—remove</code> flag does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> mean that subsequent filenames will
necessarily be removed: if the files still exist in your directory
structure, the index will be updated with their new status, not
removed. The only thing <code class="literal">—remove</code> means is that update-index will be
considering a removed file to be a valid thing, and if the file really
does not exist any more, it will update the index accordingly.</p><p>As a special case, you can also do <code class="literal">git-update-index —refresh</code>, which
will refresh the "stat" information of each index to match the current
stat information. It will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> update the object status itself, and
it will only update the fields that are used to quickly test whether
an object still matches its old backing store object.</p><p>The previously introduced <a href="git-add.html" target="_top">git-add(1)</a> is just a wrapper for
<a href="git-update-index.html" target="_top">git-update-index(1)</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="index-to-object-database"></a>index -&gt; object database</h3></div></div></div><p>You write your current index file to a "tree" object with the program</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git write-tree</p></div><p>that doesn't come with any options—it will just write out the
current index into the set of tree objects that describe that state,
and it will return the name of the resulting top-level tree. You can
use that tree to re-generate the index at any time by going in the
other direction:</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="object-database-to-index"></a>object database -&gt; index</h3></div></div></div><p>You read a "tree" file from the object database, and use that to
populate (and overwrite—don't do this if your index contains any
unsaved state that you might want to restore later!) your current
index.  Normal operation is just</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-read-tree &lt;sha1 of tree&gt;</p></div><p>and your index file will now be equivalent to the tree that you saved
earlier. However, that is only your <span class="emphasis"><em>index</em></span> file: your working
directory contents have not been modified.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="index-to-working-directory"></a>index -&gt; working directory</h3></div></div></div><p>You update your working directory from the index by "checking out"
files. This is not a very common operation, since normally you'd just
keep your files updated, and rather than write to your working
directory, you'd tell the index files about the changes in your
working directory (i.e. <code class="literal">git-update-index</code>).</p><p>However, if you decide to jump to a new version, or check out somebody
else's version, or just restore a previous tree, you'd populate your
index file with read-tree, and then you need to check out the result
with</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-checkout-index filename</p></div><p>or, if you want to check out all of the index, use <code class="literal">-a</code>.</p><p>NOTE! git-checkout-index normally refuses to overwrite old files, so
if you have an old version of the tree already checked out, you will
need to use the "-f" flag (<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the "-a" flag or the filename) to
<span class="emphasis"><em>force</em></span> the checkout.</p><p>Finally, there are a few odds and ends which are not purely moving
from one representation to the other:</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tying-it-all-together"></a>Tying it all together</h3></div></div></div><p>To commit a tree you have instantiated with "git-write-tree", you'd
create a "commit" object that refers to that tree and the history
behind it—most notably the "parent" commits that preceded it in
history.</p><p>Normally a "commit" has one parent: the previous state of the tree
before a certain change was made. However, sometimes it can have two
or more parent commits, in which case we call it a "merge", due to the
fact that such a commit brings together ("merges") two or more
previous states represented by other commits.</p><p>In other words, while a "tree" represents a particular directory state
of a working directory, a "commit" represents that state in "time",
and explains how we got there.</p><p>You create a commit object by giving it the tree that describes the
state at the time of the commit, and a list of parents:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-commit-tree &lt;tree&gt; -p &lt;parent&gt; [-p &lt;parent2&gt; ..]</p></div><p>and then giving the reason for the commit on stdin (either through
redirection from a pipe or file, or by just typing it at the tty).</p><p>git-commit-tree will return the name of the object that represents
that commit, and you should save it away for later use. Normally,
you'd commit a new <code class="literal">HEAD</code> state, and while git doesn't care where you
save the note about that state, in practice we tend to just write the
result to the file pointed at by <code class="literal">.git/HEAD</code>, so that we can always see
what the last committed state was.</p><p>Here is an ASCII art by Jon Loeliger that illustrates how

index with various helper tools. For every object, you can use
<a href="git-cat-file.html" target="_top">git-cat-file(1)</a> to examine details about the
object:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-cat-file -t &lt;objectname&gt;</p></div><p>shows the type of the object, and once you have the type (which is
usually implicit in where you find the object), you can use</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-cat-file blob|tree|commit|tag &lt;objectname&gt;</p></div><p>to show its contents. NOTE! Trees have binary content, and as a result
there is a special helper for showing that content, called
<code class="literal">git-ls-tree</code>, which turns the binary content into a more easily
readable form.</p><p>It's especially instructive to look at "commit" objects, since those
tend to be small and fairly self-explanatory. In particular, if you
follow the convention of having the top commit name in <code class="literal">.git/HEAD</code>,
you can do</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-cat-file commit HEAD</p></div><p>to see what the top commit was.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="merging-multiple-trees"></a>Merging multiple trees</h2></div></div></div><p>Git helps you do a three-way merge, which you can expand to n-way by
repeating the merge procedure arbitrary times until you finally
"commit" the state.  The normal situation is that you'd only do one
three-way merge (two parents), and commit it, but if you like to, you
can do multiple parents in one go.</p><p>To do a three-way merge, you need the two sets of "commit" objects
that you want to merge, use those to find the closest common parent (a
third "commit" object), and then use those commit objects to find the
state of the directory ("tree" object) at these points.</p><p>To get the "base" for the merge, you first look up the common parent
of two commits with</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-merge-base &lt;commit1&gt; &lt;commit2&gt;</p></div><p>which will return you the commit they are both based on.  You should
now look up the "tree" objects of those commits, which you can easily
do with (for example)</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-cat-file commit &lt;commitname&gt; | head -1</p></div><p>since the tree object information is always the first line in a commit
object.</p><p>Once you know the three trees you are going to merge (the one "original"
tree, aka the common tree, and the two "result" trees, aka the branches
you want to merge), you do a "merge" read into the index. This will
complain if it has to throw away your old index contents, so you should
make sure that you've committed those—in fact you would normally
always do a merge against your last commit (which should thus match what
you have in your current index anyway).</p><p>To do the merge, do</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-read-tree -m -u &lt;origtree&gt; &lt;yourtree&gt; &lt;targettree&gt;</p></div><p>which will do all trivial merge operations for you directly in the
index file, and you can just write the result out with
<code class="literal">git-write-tree</code>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="merging-multiple-trees-2"></a>Merging multiple trees, continued</h2></div></div></div><p>Sadly, many merges aren't trivial. If there are files that have
been added, moved or removed, or if both branches have modified the
same file, you will be left with an index tree that contains "merge
entries" in it. Such an index tree can <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> be written out to a tree
object, and you will have to resolve any such merge clashes using
other tools before you can write out the result.</p><p>You can examine such index state with <code class="literal">git-ls-files —unmerged</code>
command.  An example:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-read-tree -m $orig HEAD $target<br>
$ git-ls-files --unmerged<br>
100644 263414f423d0e4d70dae8fe53fa34614ff3e2860 1       hello.c<br>
100644 06fa6a24256dc7e560efa5687fa84b51f0263c3a 2       hello.c<br>
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello.c</p></div><p>Each line of the <code class="literal">git-ls-files —unmerged</code> output begins with
the blob mode bits, blob SHA1, <span class="emphasis"><em>stage number</em></span>, and the
filename.  The <span class="emphasis"><em>stage number</em></span> is git's way to say which tree it
came from: stage 1 corresponds to <code class="literal">$orig</code> tree, stage 2 <code class="literal">HEAD</code>
tree, and stage3 <code class="literal">$target</code> tree.</p><p>Earlier we said that trivial merges are done inside
<code class="literal">git-read-tree -m</code>.  For example, if the file did not change
from <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">HEAD</code> nor <code class="literal">$target</code>, or if the file changed
from <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">HEAD</code> and <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">$target</code> the same way,
obviously the final outcome is what is in <code class="literal">HEAD</code>.  What the
above example shows is that file <code class="literal">hello.c</code> was changed from
<code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">HEAD</code> and <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">$target</code> in a different way.
You could resolve this by running your favorite 3-way merge
program, e.g.  <code class="literal">diff3</code>, <code class="literal">merge</code>, or git's own merge-file, on
the blob objects from these three stages yourself, like this:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-cat-file blob 263414f... &gt;hello.c~1<br>
$ git-cat-file blob 06fa6a2... &gt;hello.c~2<br>
$ git-cat-file blob cc44c73... &gt;hello.c~3<br>
$ git merge-file hello.c~2 hello.c~1 hello.c~3</p></div><p>This would leave the merge result in <code class="literal">hello.c~2</code> file, along
with conflict markers if there are conflicts.  After verifying
the merge result makes sense, you can tell git what the final
merge result for this file is by:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ mv -f hello.c~2 hello.c<br>
$ git-update-index hello.c</p></div><p>When a path is in unmerged state, running <code class="literal">git-update-index</code> for
that path tells git to mark the path resolved.</p><p>The above is the description of a git merge at the lowest level,
to help you understand what conceptually happens under the hood.
In practice, nobody, not even git itself, uses three <code class="literal">git-cat-file</code>
for this.  There is <code class="literal">git-merge-index</code> program that extracts the
stages to temporary files and calls a "merge" script on it:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-merge-index git-merge-one-file hello.c</p></div><p>and that is what higher level <code class="literal">git merge -s resolve</code> is implemented with.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="hacking-git"></a>Chapter 10. Hacking git</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#object-details">Object storage format</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#birdview-on-the-source-code">A birds-eye view of Git's source code</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>This chapter covers internal details of the git implementation which
probably only git developers need to understand.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="object-details"></a>Object storage format</h2></div></div></div><p>All objects have a statically determined "type" which identifies the
format of the object (i.e. how it is used, and how it can refer to other
objects).  There are currently four different object types: "blob",
"tree", "commit", and "tag".</p><p>Regardless of object type, all objects share the following
characteristics: they are all deflated with zlib, and have a header
that not only specifies their type, but also provides size information
about the data in the object.  It's worth noting that the SHA1 hash
that is used to name the object is the hash of the original data
plus this header, so <code class="literal">sha1sum</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span> does not match the object name
for <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span>.
(Historical note: in the dawn of the age of git the hash
was the sha1 of the <span class="emphasis"><em>compressed</em></span> object.)</p><p>As a result, the general consistency of an object can always be tested
independently of the contents or the type of the object: all objects can
be validated by verifying that (a) their hashes match the content of the
file and (b) the object successfully inflates to a stream of bytes that
forms a sequence of &lt;ascii type without space&gt; + &lt;space&gt; + &lt;ascii decimal
size&gt; + &lt;byte\0&gt; + &lt;binary object data&gt;.</p><p>The structured objects can further have their structure and
connectivity to other objects verified. This is generally done with
the <code class="literal">git-fsck</code> program, which generates a full dependency graph
of all objects, and verifies their internal consistency (in addition
to just verifying their superficial consistency through the hash).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="birdview-on-the-source-code"></a>A birds-eye view of Git's source code</h2></div></div></div><p>It is not always easy for new developers to find their way through Git's
source code.  This section gives you a little guidance to show where to
start.</p><p>A good place to start is with the contents of the initial commit, with:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout e83c5163</p></div><p>The initial revision lays the foundation for almost everything git has
today, but is small enough to read in one sitting.</p><p>Note that terminology has changed since that revision.  For example, the
README in that revision uses the word "changeset" to describe what we
now call a <a href="#def_commit_object">commit</a>.</p><p>Also, we do not call it "cache" any more, but "index", however, the
file is still called <code class="literal">cache.h</code>.  Remark: Not much reason to change it now,
especially since there is no good single name for it anyway, because it is
basically _the_ header file which is included by _all_ of Git's C sources.</p><p>If you grasp the ideas in that initial commit, you should check out a
more recent version and skim <code class="literal">cache.h</code>, <code class="literal">object.h</code> and <code class="literal">commit.h</code>.</p><p>In the early days, Git (in the tradition of UNIX) was a bunch of programs
which were extremely simple, and which you used in scripts, piping the
output of one into another. This turned out to be good for initial
development, since it was easier to test new things.  However, recently
many of these parts have become builtins, and some of the core has been
"libified", i.e. put into libgit.a for performance, portability reasons,
and to avoid code duplication.</p><p>By now, you know what the index is (and find the corresponding data
structures in <code class="literal">cache.h</code>), and that there are just a couple of object types
(blobs, trees, commits and tags) which inherit their common structure from
<code class="literal">struct object</code>, which is their first member (and thus, you can cast e.g.
<code class="literal">(struct object *)commit</code> to achieve the _same_ as <code class="literal">&amp;commit-&gt;object</code>, i.e.
get at the object name and flags).</p><p>Now is a good point to take a break to let this information sink in.</p><p>Next step: get familiar with the object naming.  Read <a href="#naming-commits" title="Naming commits">the section called “Naming commits”</a>.
There are quite a few ways to name an object (and not only revisions!).
All of these are handled in <code class="literal">sha1_name.c</code>. Just have a quick look at
the function <code class="literal">get_sha1()</code>. A lot of the special handling is done by
functions like <code class="literal">get_sha1_basic()</code> or the likes.</p><p>This is just to get you into the groove for the most libified part of Git:
the revision walker.</p><p>Basically, the initial version of <code class="literal">git log</code> was a shell script:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-rev-list --pretty $(git-rev-parse --default HEAD "$@") | \<br>
        LESS=-S ${PAGER:-less}</p></div><p>What does this mean?</p><p><code class="literal">git-rev-list</code> is the original version of the revision walker, which
_always_ printed a list of revisions to stdout.  It is still functional,
and needs to, since most new Git programs start out as scripts using
<code class="literal">git-rev-list</code>.</p><p><code class="literal">git-rev-parse</code> is not as important any more; it was only used to filter out
options that were relevant for the different plumbing commands that were
called by the script.</p><p>Most of what <code class="literal">git-rev-list</code> did is contained in <code class="literal">revision.c</code> and
<code class="literal">revision.h</code>.  It wraps the options in a struct named <code class="literal">rev_info</code>, which
controls how and what revisions are walked, and more.</p><p>The original job of <code class="literal">git-rev-parse</code> is now taken by the function
<code class="literal">setup_revisions()</code>, which parses the revisions and the common command line
options for the revision walker. This information is stored in the struct
<code class="literal">rev_info</code> for later consumption. You can do your own command line option
parsing after calling <code class="literal">setup_revisions()</code>. After that, you have to call
<code class="literal">prepare_revision_walk()</code> for initialization, and then you can get the
commits one by one with the function <code class="literal">get_revision()</code>.</p><p>If you are interested in more details of the revision walking process,
just have a look at the first implementation of <code class="literal">cmd_log()</code>; call
<code class="literal">git-show v1.3.0~155^2~4</code> and scroll down to that function (note that you
no longer need to call <code class="literal">setup_pager()</code> directly).</p><p>Nowadays, <code class="literal">git log</code> is a builtin, which means that it is _contained_ in the
command <code class="literal">git</code>.  The source side of a builtin is</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
a function called <code class="literal">cmd_&lt;bla&gt;</code>, typically defined in <code class="literal">builtin-&lt;bla&gt;.c</code>,
  and declared in <code class="literal">builtin.h</code>,
</li><li>
an entry in the <code class="literal">commands[]</code> array in <code class="literal">git.c</code>, and
</li><li>
an entry in <code class="literal">BUILTIN_OBJECTS</code> in the <code class="literal">Makefile</code>.
</li></ul></div><p>Sometimes, more than one builtin is contained in one source file.  For
example, <code class="literal">cmd_whatchanged()</code> and <code class="literal">cmd_log()</code> both reside in <code class="literal">builtin-log.c</code>,
since they share quite a bit of code.  In that case, the commands which are
_not_ named like the <code class="literal">.c</code> file in which they live have to be listed in
<code class="literal">BUILT_INS</code> in the <code class="literal">Makefile</code>.</p><p><code class="literal">git log</code> looks more complicated in C than it does in the original script,
but that allows for a much greater flexibility and performance.</p><p>Here again it is a good point to take a pause.</p><p>Lesson three is: study the code.  Really, it is the best way to learn about
the organization of Git (after you know the basic concepts).</p><p>So, think about something which you are interested in, say, "how can I
access a blob just knowing the object name of it?".  The first step is to
find a Git command with which you can do it.  In this example, it is either
<code class="literal">git show</code> or <code class="literal">git cat-file</code>.</p><p>For the sake of clarity, let's stay with <code class="literal">git cat-file</code>, because it</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
is plumbing, and
</li><li>
was around even in the initial commit (it literally went only through
  some 20 revisions as <code class="literal">cat-file.c</code>, was renamed to <code class="literal">builtin-cat-file.c</code>
  when made a builtin, and then saw less than 10 versions).
</li></ul></div><p>So, look into <code class="literal">builtin-cat-file.c</code>, search for <code class="literal">cmd_cat_file()</code> and look what
it does.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>        git_config(git_default_config);<br>
        if (argc != 3)<br>
                usage("git-cat-file [-t|-s|-e|-p|&lt;type&gt;] &lt;sha1&gt;");<br>
        if (get_sha1(argv[2], sha1))<br>
                die("Not a valid object name %s", argv[2]);</p></div><p>Let's skip over the obvious details; the only really interesting part
here is the call to <code class="literal">get_sha1()</code>.  It tries to interpret <code class="literal">argv[2]</code> as an
object name, and if it refers to an object which is present in the current
repository, it writes the resulting SHA-1 into the variable <code class="literal">sha1</code>.</p><p>Two things are interesting here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<code class="literal">get_sha1()</code> returns 0 on _success_.  This might surprise some new
  Git hackers, but there is a long tradition in UNIX to return different
  negative numbers in case of different errors—and 0 on success.
</li><li>
the variable <code class="literal">sha1</code> in the function signature of <code class="literal">get_sha1()</code> is <code class="literal">unsigned
  char *</code>, but is actually expected to be a pointer to <code class="literal">unsigned
  char[20]</code>.  This variable will contain the 160-bit SHA-1 of the given
  commit.  Note that whenever a SHA-1 is passed as <code class="literal">unsigned char *</code>, it
  is the binary representation, as opposed to the ASCII representation in
  hex characters, which is passed as <code class="literal">char *</code>.
</li></ul></div><p>You will see both of these things throughout the code.</p><p>Now, for the meat:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>        case 0:<br>
                buf = read_object_with_reference(sha1, argv[1], &amp;size, NULL);</p></div><p>This is how you read a blob (actually, not only a blob, but any type of
object).  To know how the function <code class="literal">read_object_with_reference()</code> actually
works, find the source code for it (something like <code class="literal">git grep
read_object_with | grep ":[a-z]"</code> in the git repository), and read
the source.</p><p>To find out how the result can be used, just read on in <code class="literal">cmd_cat_file()</code>:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>        write_or_die(1, buf, size);</p></div><p>Sometimes, you do not know where to look for a feature.  In many such cases,
it helps to search through the output of <code class="literal">git log</code>, and then <code class="literal">git show</code> the
corresponding commit.</p><p>Example: If you know that there was some test case for <code class="literal">git bundle</code>, but
do not remember where it was (yes, you _could_ <code class="literal">git grep bundle t/</code>, but that
does not illustrate the point!):</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log --no-merges t/</p></div><p>In the pager (<code class="literal">less</code>), just search for "bundle", go a few lines back,
and see that it is in commit 18449ab0…  Now just copy this object name,
and paste it into the command line</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show 18449ab0</p></div><p>Voila.</p><p>Another example: Find out what to do in order to make some script a
builtin:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log --no-merges --diff-filter=A builtin-*.c</p></div><p>You see, Git is actually the best tool to find out about the source of Git
itself!</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="glossary"></a>Chapter 11. GIT Glossary</h2></div></div></div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">

<a name="def_tag_object"></a>tag object
</span></dt><dd>
        An <a href="#def_object">object</a> containing a <a href="#def_ref">ref</a> pointing to
        another object, which can contain a message just like a
        <a href="#def_commit_object">commit object</a>. It can also contain a (PGP)
        signature, in which case it is called a "signed tag object".
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<a name="def_topic_branch"></a>topic branch
</span></dt><dd>
        A regular git <a href="#def_branch">branch</a> that is used by a developer to
        identify a conceptual line of development. Since branches are very easy
        and inexpensive, it is often desirable to have several small branches
        that each contain very well defined concepts or small incremental yet
        related changes.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<a name="def_tracking_branch"></a>tracking branch
</span></dt><dd>
        A regular git <a href="#def_branch">branch</a> that is used to follow changes from
        another <a href="#def_repository">repository</a>. A tracking
        branch should not contain direct modifications or have local commits
        made to it. A tracking branch can usually be
        identified as the right-hand-side <a href="#def_ref">ref</a> in a Pull:
        <a href="#def_refspec">refspec</a>.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<a name="def_tree"></a>tree

        Either a <a href="#def_working_tree">working tree</a>, or a <a href="#def_tree_object">tree         object</a> together with the dependent <a href="#def_blob_object">blob</a> and tree objects
        (i.e. a stored representation of a working tree).
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<a name="def_tree_object"></a>tree object
</span></dt><dd>
        An <a href="#def_object">object</a> containing a list of file names and modes along
        with refs to the associated blob and/or tree objects. A
        <a href="#def_tree">tree</a> is equivalent to a <a href="#def_directory">directory</a>.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<a name="def_tree-ish"></a>tree-ish
</span></dt><dd>
        A <a href="#def_ref">ref</a> pointing to either a <a href="#def_commit_object">commit         object</a>, a <a href="#def_tree_object">tree object</a>, or a <a href="#def_tag_object">tag         object</a> pointing to a tag or commit or tree object.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<a name="def_unmerged_index"></a>unmerged index

</dd><dt><span class="term">
<a name="def_unreachable_object"></a>unreachable object
</span></dt><dd>
        An <a href="#def_object">object</a> which is not <a href="#def_reachable">reachable</a> from a
        <a href="#def_branch">branch</a>, <a href="#def_tag">tag</a>, or any other reference.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<a name="def_working_tree"></a>working tree

        The tree of actual checked out files.  The working tree is
        normally equal to the <a href="#def_HEAD">HEAD</a> plus any local changes
        that you have made but not yet committed.

</li><li>
Whenever possible, section headings should clearly describe the task
  they explain how to do, in language that requires no more knowledge
  than necessary: for example, "importing patches into a project" rather
  than "the git-am command"
</li></ul></div><p>Think about how to create a clear chapter dependency graph that will

howto's

some of technical/?
</li><li>
hooks

</li></ul></div><p>Scan email archives for other stuff left out</p><p>Scan man pages to see if any assume more background than this manual
provides.</p><p>Simplify beginning by suggesting disconnected head instead of
temporary branch creation?</p><p>Add more good examples.  Entire sections of just cookbook examples
might be a good idea; maybe make an "advanced examples" section a
standard end-of-chapter section?</p><p>Include cross-references to the glossary, where appropriate.</p><p>Document shallow clones?  See draft 1.5.0 release notes for some
documentation.</p><p>Add a section on working with other version control systems, including
CVS, Subversion, and just imports of series of release tarballs.</p><p>More details on gitweb?</p><p>Write a chapter on using plumbing and writing scripts.</p><p>Alternates, clone -reference, etc.</p><p>More on recovery from repository corruption.  See:
