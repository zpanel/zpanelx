git-cvsserver(1)
================

NAME
----
git-cvsserver - A CVS server emulator for git

SYNOPSIS
--------

SSH:

[verse]
export CVS_SERVER=git-cvsserver
'cvs' -d :ext:user@server/path/repo.git co <HEAD_name>

pserver (/etc/inetd.conf):

[verse]
cvspserver stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/bin/git-cvsserver git-cvsserver pserver

Usage:

[verse]
'git-cvsserver' [options] [pserver|server] [<directory> ...]

OPTIONS
-------

All these options obviously only make sense if enforced by the server side.
They have been implemented to resemble the linkgit:git-daemon[1] options as
closely as possible.

--base-path <path>::
Prepend 'path' to requested CVSROOT

--strict-paths::
Don't allow recursing into subdirectories

--export-all::
Don't check for `gitcvs.enabled` in config. You also have to specify a list
of allowed directories (see below) if you want to use this option.

-V::
--version::
Print version information and exit

-h::
-H::
--help::
Print usage information and exit

<directory>::
You can specify a list of allowed directories. If no directories
are given, all are allowed. This is an additional restriction, gitcvs
access still needs to be enabled by the `gitcvs.enabled` config option
unless '--export-all' was given, too.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This application is a CVS emulation layer for git.

It is highly functional. However, not all methods are implemented,
and for those methods that are implemented,
not all switches are implemented.

Testing has been done using both the CLI CVS client, and the Eclipse CVS
plugin. Most functionality works fine with both of these clients.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

Currently cvsserver works over SSH connections for read/write clients, and
over pserver for anonymous CVS access.

CVS clients cannot tag, branch or perform GIT merges.

git-cvsserver maps GIT branches to CVS modules. This is very different
from what most CVS users would expect since in CVS modules usually represent
one or more directories.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. If you are going to offer anonymous CVS access via pserver, add a line in
   /etc/inetd.conf like
+
--
------
   cvspserver stream tcp nowait nobody git-cvsserver pserver

------
Note: Some inetd servers let you specify the name of the executable
independently of the value of argv[0] (i.e. the name the program assumes
it was executed with). In this case the correct line in /etc/inetd.conf
looks like

------
   cvspserver stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/bin/git-cvsserver git-cvsserver pserver

------
No special setup is needed for SSH access, other than having GIT tools
in the PATH. If you have clients that do not accept the CVS_SERVER
environment variable, you can rename git-cvsserver to cvs.

Note: Newer CVS versions (>= 1.12.11) also support specifying
CVS_SERVER directly in CVSROOT like

------
cvs -d ":ext;CVS_SERVER=git-cvsserver:user@server/path/repo.git" co <HEAD_name>
------
This has the advantage that it will be saved in your 'CVS/Root' files and
you don't need to worry about always setting the correct environment
variable.  SSH users restricted to git-shell don't need to override the default
with CVS_SERVER (and shouldn't) as git-shell understands `cvs` to mean
git-cvsserver and pretends that the other end runs the real cvs better.
--
2. For each repo that you want accessible from CVS you need to edit config in
   the repo and add the following section.
+
--
------
   [gitcvs]
        enabled=1
        # optional for debugging
        logfile=/path/to/logfile

------
Note: you need to ensure each user that is going to invoke git-cvsserver has
write access to the log file and to the database (see
<<dbbackend,Database Backend>>. If you want to offer write access over
SSH, the users of course also need write access to the git repository itself.

[[configaccessmethod]]
All configuration variables can also be overridden for a specific method of
access. Valid method names are "ext" (for SSH access) and "pserver". The
following example configuration would disable pserver access while still
allowing access over SSH.
------
   [gitcvs]
        enabled=0

   [gitcvs "ext"]
        enabled=1
------
--
3. If you didn't specify the CVSROOT/CVS_SERVER directly in the checkout command,
   automatically saving it in your 'CVS/Root' files, then you need to set them
   explicitly in your environment.  CVSROOT should be set as per normal, but the
   directory should point at the appropriate git repo.  As above, for SSH clients
   _not_ restricted to git-shell, CVS_SERVER should be set to git-cvsserver.
+
--
------
     export CVSROOT=:ext:user@server:/var/git/project.git
     export CVS_SERVER=git-cvsserver
------
--
4. For SSH clients that will make commits, make sure their server-side
   .ssh/environment files (or .bashrc, etc., according to their specific shell)
   export appropriate values for GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL,
   GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, and GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL.  For SSH clients whose login
   shell is bash, .bashrc may be a reasonable alternative.

5. Clients should now be able to check out the project. Use the CVS 'module'
   name to indicate what GIT 'head' you want to check out.  This also sets the
   name of your newly checked-out directory, unless you tell it otherwise with
   `-d <dir_name>`.  For example, this checks out 'master' branch to the
   `project-master` directory:
+
------
     cvs co -d project-master master
------

[[dbbackend]]
Database Backend
----------------

git-cvsserver uses one database per git head (i.e. CVS module) to
store information about the repository for faster access. The
database doesn't contain any persistent data and can be completely
regenerated from the git repository at any time. The database
needs to be updated (i.e. written to) after every commit.

If the commit is done directly by using git (as opposed to
using git-cvsserver) the update will need to happen on the
next repository access by git-cvsserver, independent of
access method and requested operation.

That means that even if you offer only read access (e.g. by using
the pserver method), git-cvsserver should have write access to
the database to work reliably (otherwise you need to make sure
that the database is up-to-date any time git-cvsserver is executed).

By default it uses SQLite databases in the git directory, named
`gitcvs.<module_name>.sqlite`. Note that the SQLite backend creates
temporary files in the same directory as the database file on
write so it might not be enough to grant the users using
git-cvsserver write access to the database file without granting
them write access to the directory, too.

You can configure the database backend with the following
configuration variables:

Configuring database backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

git-cvsserver uses the Perl DBI module. Please also read
its documentation if changing these variables, especially
about `DBI->connect()`.

gitcvs.dbname::
	Database name. The exact meaning depends on the
	selected database driver, for SQLite this is a filename.
	Supports variable substitution (see below). May
	not contain semicolons (`;`).
	Default: '%Ggitcvs.%m.sqlite'

gitcvs.dbdriver::
	Used DBI driver. You can specify any available driver
	for this here, but it might not work. cvsserver is tested
	with 'DBD::SQLite', reported to work with
	'DBD::Pg', and reported *not* to work with 'DBD::mysql'.
	Please regard this as an experimental feature. May not
	contain colons (`:`).
	Default: 'SQLite'

gitcvs.dbuser::
	Database user. Only useful if setting `dbdriver`, since
	SQLite has no concept of database users. Supports variable
	substitution (see below).

gitcvs.dbpass::
	Database password.  Only useful if setting `dbdriver`, since
	SQLite has no concept of database passwords.

gitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix::
	Database table name prefix.  Supports variable substitution
	(see below).  Any non-alphabetic characters will be replaced
	with underscores.

All variables can also be set per access method, see <<configaccessmethod,above>>.

Variable substitution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In `dbdriver` and `dbuser` you can use the following variables:

%G::
	git directory name
%g::
	git directory name, where all characters except for
	alpha-numeric ones, `.`, and `-` are replaced with
	`_` (this should make it easier to use the directory
	name in a filename if wanted)
%m::
	CVS module/git head name
%a::
	access method (one of "ext" or "pserver")
%u::
	Name of the user running git-cvsserver.
	If no name can be determined, the
	numeric uid is used.

Eclipse CVS Client Notes
------------------------

To get a checkout with the Eclipse CVS client:

1. Select "Create a new project -> From CVS checkout"
2. Create a new location. See the notes below for details on how to choose the
   right protocol.
3. Browse the 'modules' available. It will give you a list of the heads in
   the repository. You will not be able to browse the tree from there. Only
   the heads.
4. Pick 'HEAD' when it asks what branch/tag to check out. Untick the
   "launch commit wizard" to avoid committing the .project file.

Protocol notes: If you are using anonymous access via pserver, just select that.
Those using SSH access should choose the 'ext' protocol, and configure 'ext'
access on the Preferences->Team->CVS->ExtConnection pane. Set CVS_SERVER to
'git-cvsserver'. Note that password support is not good when using 'ext',
you will definitely want to have SSH keys setup.

Alternatively, you can just use the non-standard extssh protocol that Eclipse
offer. In that case CVS_SERVER is ignored, and you will have to replace
the cvs utility on the server with git-cvsserver or manipulate your `.bashrc`
so that calling 'cvs' effectively calls git-cvsserver.

Clients known to work
---------------------

- CVS 1.12.9 on Debian
- CVS 1.11.17 on MacOSX (from Fink package)
- Eclipse 3.0, 3.1.2 on MacOSX (see Eclipse CVS Client Notes)
- TortoiseCVS

Operations supported
--------------------

All the operations required for normal use are supported, including
checkout, diff, status, update, log, add, remove, commit.
Legacy monitoring operations are not supported (edit, watch and related).
Exports and tagging (tags and branches) are not supported at this stage.

CRLF Line Ending Conversions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the server leaves the '-k' mode blank for all files,
which causes the cvs client to treat them as a text files, subject
to crlf conversion on some platforms.

You can make the server use `crlf` attributes to set the '-k' modes
for files by setting the `gitcvs.usecrlfattr` config variable.
In this case, if `crlf` is explicitly unset ('-crlf'), then the
server will set '-kb' mode for binary files. If `crlf` is set,
then the '-k' mode will explicitly be left blank.  See
also linkgit:gitattributes[5] for more information about the `crlf`
attribute.

Alternatively, if `gitcvs.usecrlfattr` config is not enabled
or if the `crlf` attribute is unspecified for a filename, then
the server uses the `gitcvs.allbinary` config for the default setting.
If `gitcvs.allbinary` is set, then file not otherwise
specified will default to '-kb' mode. Otherwise the '-k' mode
is left blank. But if `gitcvs.allbinary` is set to "guess", then
the correct '-k' mode will be guessed based on the contents of
the file.

For best consistency with cvs, it is probably best to override the
defaults by setting `gitcvs.usecrlfattr` to true,
and `gitcvs.allbinary` to "guess".

Dependencies
------------

git-cvsserver depends on DBD::SQLite.
