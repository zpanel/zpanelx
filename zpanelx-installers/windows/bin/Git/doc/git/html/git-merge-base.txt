NAME
----
git-merge-base - Find as good common ancestors as possible for a merge


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-merge-base' [--all] <commit> <commit>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

"git-merge-base" finds as good a common ancestor as possible between
the two commits. That is, given two commits A and B 'git-merge-base A
B' will output a commit which is reachable from both A and B through
the parent relationship.

Given a selection of equally good common ancestors it should not be
relied on to decide in any particular way.

The "git-merge-base" algorithm is still in flux - use the source...

OPTIONS
-------
--all::
	Output all common ancestors for the two commits instead of
	just one.
